In particular I note that Canada and the Community and its Member States, to the extent of their respective competences, have made an effective commitment to non-proliferation and have submitted all relevant material to IAEA safeguards, and to adequate physical protection measures, in paragraphs (c) and (g) of the exchange of letters completed by the letters from Member States' foreign ministers to Canadian ambassadors on physical protection. I also note that the Community has provided Canada with the description of the current and planned nuclear energy programmes of the Community and of its Member States and that the notification and material reporting procedures have been settled. 4. Finally I note that these arrangements take into account inter alia the results of INFCE's studies in relation to the operations in question, as envisaged in paragraph 5 of Annex C to the exchange of letters. I note that the parties, in particular, acknowledge that the separation, storage, transportation and use of plutonium require particular measures to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation; are determined to continue to support the development of international safeguards and other non-proliferation measures relevant to reprocessing and plutonium, including an effective and generally accepted international plutonium storage scheme; recognize the role of reprocessing in connection with the maximum use of available resources and the management of materials contained in spent fuel or other peaceful non-explosive uses, including research, in particular in the context of significant nuclear energy programmes; and desire the predictable and practical implementation of paragraph (e) of the exchange of letters taking into account both their determination to ensure the furtherance of the objective of non-proliferation and the long-term needs of the nuclear energy programmes of the parties. 5. I have the honour to inform the Commission that pursuant to the above, in accordance with paragraph (e) of the exchange of letters, the Government of Canada agrees that material subject to the Agreement may be reprocessed and plutonium stored within the framework of the current and planned nuclear energy programmes as described and up-dated from time to time by the Community and its Member States. 6.

I have the honour to confirm that the documents containing the descriptions of current and planned nuclear energy programmes of the Community and its Member States shall remain confidential to the Contracting Parties. 9. If the foregoing is acceptable to the European Atomic Energy Community, I have the honour to propose that this letter, which is authentic in both English and French, together with Your Excellency's reply to that effect shall constitute the Agreement required by paragraph (e) of the exchange of letters, and replace both Annex C thereto and the 23 December 1980 exchange of letters.
