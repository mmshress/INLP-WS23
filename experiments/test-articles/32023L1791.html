The need to capture the cost-effective energy saving opportunities has led to the Union’s current energy efficiency policy. In December 2018, a new 2030 Union headline energy efficiency target of at least 32,5 %, compared to projected energy use in 2030, was included as part of the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, which aimed at putting energy efficiency first, achieving global leadership in renewable energies and providing a fair deal for consumers.</p>

Even with the rapid growth of renewable electricity generation, energy efficiency can reduce the need of new power generation capacity and the costs relating to storage, transmission and distribution. Increased energy efficiency is also particularly important for the security of the energy supply of the Union, by lowering the Union’s dependence on the import of fuels from third countries. Energy efficiency is one of the cleanest and most cost-efficient measures by which to address that dependence.</p>

Both cases are significant efforts that should be recognised and should be included in the Union’s future modelling projections and that can serve as good examples of how all Member States can work on their energy efficiency potential to deliver significant benefits to their economies and societies.</p>

Another increasingly important sector is the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, which is responsible for 5 to 9 % of the world’s total electricity use and more than 2 % of global emissions. In 2018, data centres accounted for 2,7 % of the electricity demand in the EU-28. In that context, the Commission, in its communication of 19 February 2020 on ‘Shaping Europe's digital future’ (the ‘Union’s Digital Strategy’), highlighted the need for highly energy-efficient and sustainable data centres and transparency measures for telecoms operators as regards their environmental footprint. Furthermore, the possible increase in industry’s energy demand that may result from its decarbonisation, particularly for energy intensive processes, should also be taken into account.</p>

Improving energy efficiency throughout the full energy chain, including energy generation, transmission, distribution and end-use, will benefit the environment, improve air quality and public health, reduce GHG emissions, improve energy security by decreasing the need for energy imports, in particular of fossil fuels, cut energy costs for households and companies, help alleviate energy poverty, and lead to increased competitiveness, more jobs and increased economic activity throughout the economy. Improving energy efficiency would thus improve citizens’ quality of life, while contributing to the transformation of the Union’s energy relations with third-country partners towards achieving climate neutrality. That complies with the Union commitments made in the framework of the Energy Union and global climate agenda established by the Paris Agreement. Improving the energy performance of various sectors has the potential of fostering urban regeneration, including improvement of buildings, and changes in mobility and accessibility patterns, while promoting more efficient, sustainable and affordable options.</p>

The energy efficiency first principle is an overarching principle that should be taken into account across all sectors, going beyond the energy system, at all levels, including in the financial sector. Energy efficiency solutions should be considered as the first option in policy, planning and investment decisions when setting new rules for the supply side and other policy areas. While the energy efficiency first principle should be applied without prejudice to other legal obligations, objectives and principles, such obligations, objectives and principles should not hamper its application or lead to exemptions from applying the principle. The Commission should ensure that energy efficiency and demand response can compete on equal terms with generation capacity. Energy efficiency improvements need to be made whenever they are more cost-effective than equivalent supply-side solutions. That should help exploit the multiple benefits of energy efficiency for the Union, in particular for citizens and businesses. Implementing energy efficiency improvement measures should also be a priority in alleviating energy poverty.</p>

For an increased climate ambition of a 55 % decrease of GHG emissions by 2030, the impact assessment of the Climate Target Plan assessed what level of efforts would be needed in the different policy areas. It concluded that, in relation to the baseline, achieving the GHG emissions target in a cost-optimal way meant that primary energy consumption and final energy consumption are to decrease by at least 39 to 41 % and 36 to 37 % respectively.</p>

The change in the Eurostat energy balance calculation methodology and improvements in subsequent modelling projections call for a change of the baseline. Thus, using the same approach to define the target, namely by comparing it to the future baseline projections, the ambition of the Union’s 2030 energy efficiency target is set compared to the 2020 EU Reference Scenario projections for 2030 reflecting national contributions from the national energy and climate plans. With that updated baseline, the Union will need to further increase its energy efficiency ambition by at least 11,7 % in 2030 compared to the level of efforts under the 2020 EU Reference Scenario. The new way of expressing the level of ambition for the Union’s targets does not affect the actual level of efforts needed and corresponds to a reduction of 40,5 % for primary energy consumption and 38 % for final energy consumption when compared to the 2007 EU Reference Scenario projections for 2030.</p>

The 2020 EU Reference Scenario projects 864 Mtoe of final energy consumption and 1 124 Mtoe of primary energy consumption to be reached in 2030 (excluding ambient energy and including international aviation). An additional reduction of 11,7 % results in 763 Mtoe and 992,5 Mtoe in 2030. Compared to 2005 levels, it means that final energy consumption in the Union should be reduced by approximately 25 % and primary energy consumption should be reduced by approximately 34 %. There are no binding targets at Member State level in the 2020 and 2030 perspectives, and Member States should establish their contributions to the achievement of the Union’s energy efficiency target taking into account the formula provided for in this Directive. Member States should be free to set their national objectives based either on primary energy consumption or final energy consumption or primary energy savings or final energy savings, or on energy intensity. This Directive amends the way in which Member States should express their national contributions to the Union’s target. Member States’ contributions to the Union’s target should be expressed in primary energy consumption and final energy consumption to ensure consistency and monitoring of progress. A regular evaluation of progress towards the achievement of the Union’s 2030 targets is necessary and is provided for in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.</p>

Public authorities spend approximately EUR 1 800 000 000 000 every year. This represents around 14 % of the Union’s gross domestic product. For that reason the public sector constitutes an important driver to stimulate market transformation towards more efficient products, buildings and services, as well as to trigger behavioural changes in energy consumption by citizens and enterprises. Furthermore, decreasing energy consumption through energy efficiency improvement measures can free up public resources for other purposes.

An obligation to achieve an annual reduction of the energy consumption in the public sector by at least 1,9 % should ensure that the public sector fulfils its exemplary role. Member States retain full flexibility regarding the choice of energy efficiency improvement measures to achieve a reduction of the final energy consumption.

To determine the scope of addressees, Member States should apply the definition of ‘public bodies’ provided for in this Directive, where ‘directly financed by those authorities’ means that those entities are mostly funded by public funds and ‘administered by those authorities’ means that a national, regional or local authority has a majority with regard to the choice of the entity’s management. The obligation can be fulfilled by the reduction of final energy consumption in any area of the public sector, including transport, public buildings, healthcare, spatial planning, water management and wastewater treatment, sewage and water purification, waste management, district heating and cooling, energy distribution, supply and storage, public lighting, infrastructure planning, education and social services. Member States may also include other types of services when transposing this Directive. To lower the administrative burden for public bodies, Member States should establish digital platforms or tools to collect the aggregated consumption data from public bodies, make them publicly available, and report the data to the Commission. Member States should provide planning and annual reporting on the consumption of public bodies in an aggregated form per sector.</p>

Centralised agencies can serve the needs better and work more effectively in other respects, for example, in smaller or centralised Member States or regarding complex or cross-regional aspects such as district heating and cooling. Sustainable energy agencies can serve as one-stop shops. Those agencies are often responsible for developing local or regional decarbonisation plans, which may also include other decarbonisation measures, such as the exchange of fossil fuel boilers, and for supporting public authorities in the implementation of energy-related policies. Sustainable energy agencies or other entities to assist regional and local authorities may have clear competences, objectives and resources in the field of sustainable energy. Sustainable energy agencies could be encouraged to consider initiatives taken in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors, which brings together local governments voluntarily committed to implementing the Union’s climate and energy objectives, and other existing initiatives for that purpose. The decarbonisation plans should be linked to territorial development plans and take into account the comprehensive assessment which the Member States should carry out.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Buildings and transport, alongside industry, are the main energy users and main source of emissions. Buildings are responsible for about 40 % of the Union’s total energy consumption and for 36 % of its GHG from energy. The Commission communication of 14 October 2020, entitled ‘Renovation Wave’ addresses the twin challenge of energy and resource efficiency and affordability in the building sector and aims to double the renovation rate. It focuses on the worst performing buildings, energy poverty and on public buildings. Moreover, buildings are crucial to achieving the Union objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050. Buildings that are owned by public bodies account for a considerable share of the building stock and have high visibility in public life. It is therefore appropriate to set an annual rate of renovation of buildings that are owned by public bodies on the territory of a Member State to upgrade their energy performance and be transformed into at least nearly zero-energy buildings or zero-emission buildings. Member States are invited to set a higher renovation rate, where that is cost-effective in the framework of the renovation of their buildings stock in accordance with their long-term renovation strategies or national renovation programmes, or both. That renovation rate should be without prejudice to the obligations with regard to nearly zero-energy buildings set out in Directive 2010/31/EU. Member States should be able to apply less stringent requirements to some buildings, such as buildings with special architectural or historical merit. During the next review of Directive 2010/31/EU, the Commission should assess the progress Member States achieved regarding the renovation of public bodies’ buildings. The Commission should consider submitting a legislative proposal to revise the renovation rate, while taking into account the progress achieved by the Member States, substantial economic or technical developments, or where needed, the Union’s commitments for decarbonisation and zero pollution. The obligation to renovate public bodies’ buildings in this Directive complements that in Directive 2010/31/EU, which requires Member States to ensure that when existing buildings undergo major renovation their energy performance is upgraded so that they meet the requirements on nearly zero-energy buildings.</p>

It therefore measures the building’s overall contribution to emissions that lead to climate change. That is sometimes referred to as a carbon footprint assessment or the whole life carbon measurement. It brings together carbon emissions embodied in building materials with direct and indirect carbon emissions from use stage. Buildings are a significant material bank, being repositories for carbon intensive resources over many decades, and so it is important to explore designs that facilitate future reuse and recycling at the end of the operational life in line with the new circular economy action plan. Member States should promote circularity, durability, and adaptability of building materials, in order to address the sustainability performance of construction products.</p>

The energy savings obligation plays an important role in the creation of local growth, jobs, competitiveness and alleviating energy poverty. It should ensure that the Union can achieve its energy and climate objectives by creating further opportunities and by breaking the link between energy consumption and growth.

                           <p class="oj-normal">When designing policy measures to fulfil the energy savings obligation, Member States should respect the climate and environmental standards and priorities of the Union and comply with the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. Member States should not promote activities that are not environmentally sustainable such as the use of fossil fuels. The energy savings obligation aims at strengthening the response to climate change by promoting incentives to Member States to implement a sustainable and clean policy mix, which is resilient, and mitigates climate change. Therefore, energy savings from policy measures regarding the use of direct fossil fuel combustion may be eligible energy savings under the energy savings obligation under certain conditions and for a transitional period following the transposition of this Directive in accordance with an annex to this Directive. It will allow aligning the energy savings obligation with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the Climate Target Plan, the Renovation Wave, and mirror the need for action identified by the International Energy Agency in its net zero report. The restriction aims at encouraging Member States to spend public money into future-proof, sustainable technologies only. It is important that Member States provide a clear policy framework and investment certainty to market actors. The implementation of the calculation methodology under the energy savings obligation should allow all market actors to adapt their technologies in a reasonable timeframe. Where Member States support the uptake of efficient fossil fuel technologies or early replacement of such technology, for example through subsidy schemes or energy efficiency obligation schemes, any resulting energy savings may no longer be eligible under the energy savings obligation. While energy savings resulting, for example, from the promotion of natural gas-based cogeneration would not be eligible under the energy savings obligation, the restriction would not apply for indirect fossil fuel usage, for example where the electricity production includes fossil fuel generation. Policy measures targeting behavioural changes to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, for example through information campaigns and eco-driving, should remain eligible. Policy measures which target building renovations may include measures such as the replacement of fossil fuel heating systems together with building fabric improvements. Those measures should be limited to technologies that allow the required energy savings to be achieved in accordance with the national building codes established in a Member State. Nevertheless, Member States should promote upgrading heating systems as part of deep renovations in line with the long-term objective of carbon neutrality, namely reducing the heating demand and covering the remaining heating demand with a carbon-free energy source. When accounting for the savings needed to achieve a share of the energy savings obligation among people affected by energy poverty, Member States may take into account their climatic conditions.</p>

In order to calculate the impact of the measures introduced, only net savings, measured as the change of energy consumption that is directly attributable to the energy efficiency measure in question implemented for the purpose of the energy savings obligation provided for in this Directive, should be counted. To calculate net savings, Member States should establish a baseline scenario of how the situation would evolve in the absence of the measure in question. The policy measure in question should be evaluated against that baseline. Member States should take into account minimum requirements provided by the relevant legislative framework at Union level and the fact that other policy measures may be carried out in the same time frame which may also have an impact on the amount of energy savings, so that not all changes observed since the introduction of a particular policy measure can be attributed to that policy measure alone.

                           <p class="oj-normal">Consideration of the water-energy nexus is particularly important to address the interdependent use of energy and water and the increasing pressure on both resources. The effective management of water can make a significant contribution to energy savings yielding not only climate benefits, but also economic and social benefits. The water and wastewater sectors account for 3,5 % of electricity use in the Union and that share is expected to rise. At the same time, water leaks account for 24 % of total water consumed in the Union and the energy sector is the largest consumer of water, accounting for 44 % of consumption. The potential for energy savings through the use of smart technologies and processes across all industrial, residential and commercial water cycles and applications should be fully explored and realised whenever cost-effective, and the energy efficiency first principle should be considered. In addition, advanced irrigation technologies, rainwater harvesting and water reuse technologies could substantially reduce water consumption in agriculture, buildings and industry and the energy used for treating and transporting it.</p>

Improvements in energy efficiency should be implemented as a priority among people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers and final users, people in low-income or medium-income households, people living in social housing, older people as well as people living in rural and remote areas and in the outermost regions. In that context, specific attention should be paid to particular groups which are more at risk of being affected by energy poverty or are more susceptible to the adverse impacts of energy poverty, such as women, persons with disabilities, older people, children, and people with a minority racial or ethnic background. Member States can require obligated parties to include social aims in energy-saving measures in relation to energy poverty, and this possibility has already been extended to alternative policy measures and national energy efficiency funds. That should be transformed into an obligation to protect and empower vulnerable customers and final users and to alleviate energy poverty, while allowing Member States to retain full flexibility with regard to the type of policy measure, its size, scope and content. If an energy efficiency obligation scheme does not permit measures relating to individual energy consumers, the Member State may take measures to alleviate energy poverty by means of alternative policy measures alone. Within their policy mix, Member States should ensure that other policy measures do not have an adverse effect on people affected by energy poverty vulnerable customers, final users and, where applicable, people living in social housing. Member States should make best possible use of public funding investments into energy efficiency improvement measures, including funding and financial facilities established at Union level.</p>

The European Green Deal prioritises the social dimension of the transition by committing to the principle that ‘no one is left behind’. The green transition, including the clean transition, affects women and men differently and may have a particular impact on some disadvantaged groups including people with disabilities. Energy efficiency measures must therefore be central to any cost-effective strategy to address energy poverty and consumer vulnerability and are complementary to social security policies at Member State level. To ensure that energy efficiency measures reduce energy poverty for tenants sustainably, the cost-effectiveness of such measures, as well as their affordability to property owners and tenants, should be taken into account, and adequate financial and technical support for such measures should be guaranteed at Member State level. Member States should support the local and regional level in identifying and alleviating energy poverty. The Union’s building stock needs, in the long term, to be converted to nearly zero-energy buildings in accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Current building renovation rates are insufficient and buildings occupied by citizens on low incomes who are affected by energy poverty are the hardest to reach. The measures laid down in this Directive with regard to energy savings obligations, energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures are therefore of particular importance.</p>

Energy audits should be mandatory and regular for enterprises with an average annual energy consumption above a certain threshold, as energy savings can be significant. Energy audits should take into account relevant European or international standards, such as EN ISO 50001 (Energy Management Systems), or EN 16247-1 (Energy Audits), or, if including an energy audit, EN ISO 14000 (Environmental Management Systems) and thus be also in accordance with this Directive, which does not go beyond the requirements of those relevant standards. A specific European standard on energy audits is currently under development. Energy audits may be carried out on a stand-alone basis or be part of a broader environmental management system or an energy performance contract. In all such cases those systems should comply with the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive. In addition, specific mechanisms and schemes established to monitor emissions and fuel consumption by certain transport operators, for example under Union law the EU ETS, may be considered compatible with energy audits, including in energy management systems, if they comply with the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive. For those enterprises already implementing the energy audit obligation, energy audits should continue to be carried out at least every four years from the date of the previous energy audit, in accordance with this Directive.</p>

In 2018 the energy consumption of data centres in the Union was 76,8 TWh. This is expected to rise to 98,5 TWh by 2030, a 28 % increase. This increase in absolute terms can also be seen in relative terms: within the Union, data centres accounted for 2,7 % of electricity demand in 2018 and will reach 3,21 % by 2030 if development continues on the current trajectory. The Union’s Digital Strategy already highlighted the need for highly energy-efficient and sustainable data centres and calls for transparency measures for telecommunication operators on their environmental footprint. To promote sustainable development in the ICT sector, particularly of data centres, Member States should require the collection and publication of data which are relevant for the energy performance, water footprint and demand-side flexibility of data centres, on the basis of a common Union template. Member States should require the collection and publication of data only about data centres with a significant footprint, for which appropriate design or efficiency interventions, for new or existing installations respectively, can result in a considerable reduction of energy and water consumption, an increase in systems’ efficiency promoting decarbonisation of the grid or in the reuse of waste heat in nearby facilities and heat networks. Data centre sustainability indicators could be established on the basis of that data collected, taking also into account already existing initiatives in the sector.</p>

New electricity generation installations and existing installations which are substantially refurbished or whose permit or licence is updated should, subject to a cost-benefit analysis showing a cost-benefit surplus, be equipped with high-efficiency cogeneration units to recover waste heat stemming from the production of electricity. Similarly, other facilities with substantial annual average energy input should be equipped with technical solutions to deploy waste heat from the facility where the cost-benefit analysis shows a cost-benefit surplus. This waste heat could be transported where it is needed through district heating networks. The events that trigger a requirement for authorisation criteria to be applied will generally be such as to also trigger requirements for permits under Directive 2010/75/EU and for authorisation under Directive (EU) 2019/944.</p>

Several factors impede consumers from accessing, understanding and acting upon the various sources of market information available to them. The introduction of basic contractual rights can help, among others, with a proper understanding of the baseline of the quality of services offered in the contract by the supplier, including the quality and characteristics of the supplied energy. In addition, it can contribute to the minimisation of hidden or extra costs that could result from the introduction of either upgraded or new services after the signing of the contract without a clear understanding and agreement by the customer. Those services could concern, among others, the energy supplied, metering and billing services, purchase and installation or ancillary and maintenance services and costs relating to the network, metering devices, local heating or cooling equipment. The requirements will contribute to the improvement of comparability of offers and ensure the same level of basic contractual rights for all Union citizens regarding heating, cooling and domestic hot water, without restricting national competences.</p>

Member States should, therefore, consider and promote the role of renewable energy communities and citizen energy communities. Those communities can help Member States to achieve the objectives of this Directive by advancing energy efficiency at local or household level, as well as in public buildings, in cooperation with local authorities. They can empower and engage consumers and enable certain groups of household customers, including in rural and remote areas, to participate in energy efficiency projects and interventions that can combine actions with investment in renewable energy. Energy communities can have a strong role to play in educating and increasing citizens’ awareness of measures designed to achieve energy savings. If properly supported by Member States, energy communities can help fighting energy poverty through the facilitation of energy efficiency projects, reduced energy consumption and lower supply tariffs.</p>

Without prejudice to security of supply, market integration and anticipatory investments in offshore grids necessary for the deployment of offshore renewable energy, national energy regulatory authorities should ensure that the energy efficiency first principle is applied in the planning and decision-making processes and that network tariffs and regulations incentivise improvements in energy efficiency. Member States should also ensure that transmission and distribution system operators consider the energy efficiency first principle. That would help transmission and distribution system operators to consider better energy efficiency solutions for and incremental costs incurred from the procurement of demand-side resources, as well as the environmental and socio-economic impacts of different network investments and operation plans. Such an approach requires a shift from the narrow economic efficiency perspective to maximised social welfare. The energy efficiency first principle should in particular be applied in the context of scenario building for energy infrastructure expansion where demand-side solutions could be considered as viable alternatives and need to be properly assessed, and should become an intrinsic part of the assessment of network planning projects. Its application should be scrutinised by national regulatory authorities.</p>

Transparency, for example by means of lists of certified energy services providers and available model contracts, exchange of best practices and guidelines greatly contribute to the uptake of energy services and energy performance contracting and can also help stimulate demand and increase the trust in energy services providers. In an energy performance contract the beneficiary of the energy service avoids investment costs by using part of the financial value of energy savings to fully or partially repay the investment carried out by a third party. That can help attract private capital which is key for increasing building renovation rates in the Union, bring expertise into the market and create innovative business models. Therefore, non-residential buildings with the useful floor area above 750 m<span class="oj-super">2</span> should be required to assess the feasibility of using energy performance contracting for renovation.

Local energy agencies could play a key role in that regard, and identify and support setting up potential facilitators or one-stop shops. This Directive should help improve the availability of products, services and advice, including by promoting the potential for entrepreneurs to fill the gaps in the market and to provide for innovative ways to enhance energy efficiency, while ensuring respect for the principle of non-discrimination.</p>

The calculation methodology is in accordance with the Eurostat energy balances and definitions, except for the allocation method of fuel input for heat and electricity in combined heat and power plants, for which the efficiency of the reference system, required for the allocation of fuel consumption, was aligned with Eurostat data for 2015 and 2020. Calculations reflecting the energy mix of the primary energy factor for electricity are based on annual average values. The ‘physical energy content’ accounting method is used for nuclear electricity and heat generation and the ‘technical conversion efficiency’ method is used for electricity and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass. For non-combustible renewable energy, the method is the direct equivalent based on the ‘total primary energy’ approach. To calculate the primary energy share for electricity in cogeneration, the method set out in this Directive is applied. An average rather than a marginal market position is used. Conversion efficiencies are assumed to be 100 % for non-combustible renewables, 10 % for geothermal power stations and 33 % for nuclear power stations. The calculation of total efficiency for cogeneration is based on the most recent data from Eurostat. The conversion, transmission and distribution losses are taken into account. Distribution losses for energy carriers other than electricity are not considered in the calculations, due to the lack of reliable data and the complexity of the calculation. As for system boundaries, the primary energy factor is 1 for all energy sources. The selected coefficient for the primary energy factor for electricity is the average of 2024 and 2025 values, since a forward-looking primary energy factor will provide a more appropriate indicator than a historical one. The analysis covers the Member States and Norway. The dataset for Norway is based on the ENTSO-E data.</p>

Buildings present a substantial potential for further increasing energy efficiency, and the renovation of buildings is an essential and long-term element with economies of scale in increasing energy savings. It is therefore necessary to clarify that it is possible to claim all energy savings stemming from measures promoting the renovation of existing buildings, provided that they exceed the savings that would have occurred in the absence of the policy measure and provided that the Member State demonstrates that the obligated, participating or entrusted party has in fact contributed to the achievement of the energy savings claimed.</p>
