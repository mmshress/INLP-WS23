3. From other sources
4. Stocks at end of period4.1. Of which: stocks at mines
1.5. Units of measurement
1. Energy quantities 10
3tonnes
Exception: for gases (gasworks gas, coke oven gas, blast furnace gas, oxygen steel
furnace gas) the measurement is directly in energy content and the unit to be used is
therefore TJ (based on gross calorific values).
2. Calorific values MJ/tonne
1.6. Derogations and exemptions
Not applicable.
2. NATURAL GAS
2.1. Applicable energy products
This data collection applies to natural gas, which comprises gases occurring in underground deposits, whether
liquefied or gaseous, consisting mainly of methane.
It includes both ‘non-associated’ gas originating from fields producing hydrocarbons only in gaseous form, and
‘associated’ gas produced in association with crude oil as well as methane recovered from coal mines (colliery gas)
or from coal seams (coal seam gas).
It does not include gases created by anaerobic digestion of biomass (e.g. municipal or sewage gas) nor gasworks gas.
2.2. List of aggregates
The following list of aggregates shall be declared for all energy products listed in the previous paragraph unless
otherwise specified.
2.2.1. Supply and transformation sectors
To be declared are quantities expressed in both volume and energy units, and including the gross and net calorific
values, for the following aggregates:
1. Indigenous production
All dry marketable production within national boundaries, including offshore production. Production is
measured after purification and extraction of NGLs and sulphur.
Excludes extraction losses and quantities reinjected, vented or flared.Includes quantities used within the natural gas industry; in gas extraction, pipeline systems and processing
plants.
1.1. Of which: associated gas
Natural gas produced in association with crude oil.
1.2. Of which: non-associated gas
Natural gas originating from fields producing hydrocarbons only in gaseous form.
1.3. Of which: colliery gas
Methane produced at coal mines or from coal seams, piped to the surface and consumed at collieries or
transmitted by pipeline to consumers.L 304/18 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
