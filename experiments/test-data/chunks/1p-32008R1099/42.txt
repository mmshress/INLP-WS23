Energy product Definition
3. Solar energy Solar radiation exploited for hot water production and electricity generation. This
energy production is the heat available to the heat transfer medium, i.e. the incident
solar energy less the optical and collectors' losses. Passive solar energy for the direct
heating, cooling and lighting of dwellings or other buildings is not included.
3.1. Of which: solar
photovoltaicSunlight converted into electricity by the use of solar cells usually made of semi-
conducting material which exposed to light will generate electricity.
3.2. Of which: solar
thermalHeat from solar radiation; can consist of:
(a) solar thermal-electric plants; or(b) equipment for the production of domestic hot water or for the seasonal
heating of swimming pools (e.g. flat plate collectors, mainly of the
thermosyphon type).
4. Tide, wave, ocean Mechanical energy derived from tidal movement, wave motion or ocean current and
exploited for electricity generation.
5. Wind Kinetic energy of wind exploited for electricity generation in wind turbines.
6. Industrial waste
(non-renewable)Report wastes of industrial non-renewable origin (solids or liquids) combusted
directly for the production of electricity and/or heat. The quantity of fuel used should
be reported on a net calorific value basis. Renewable industrial waste should be
reported in the solid biomass, biogas and/or liquid biofuels categories.
7. Municipal waste Wastes produced by households, hospitals and the tertiary sector incinerated at
specific installations, on a net calorific value basis.
7.1. Of which: renewable The portion of municipal waste which is of biological origin.7.2. Of which: non-
renewableThe portion of municipal waste which is of non-biological origin.
8. Solid biomass Covers organic, non-fossil material of biological origin which may be used as fuel for
heat production or electricity generation. It comprises:
8.1. Of which: charcoal The solid residue of the destructive distillation and pyrolysis of wood and other
vegetal material.
8.2. Of which: wood,
wood wastes, other
solid wastesPurpose-grown energy crops (poplar, willow etc.), a multitude of woody materials
generated by an industrial process (wood/paper industry in particular) or provided
directly by forestry and agriculture (firewood, wood chips, wood pellets, bark,
sawdust, shavings, chips, black liquor etc.) as well as wastes such as straw, rice husks,
nut shells, poultry litter, crushed grape dregs etc. Combustion is the preferred
technology for these solid wastes. The quantity of fuel used should be reported on a
net calorific value basis.
9. Biogas A gas composed principally of methane and carbon dioxide produced by anaerobic
digestion of biomass.
9.1. Of which: landfill
gasA biogas formed by the digestion of landfilled wastes.
9.2. Of which: sewage
sludge gasA biogas produced from the anaerobic fermentation of sewage sludge.
9.3. Of which: other
biogasBiogas produced from the anaerobic fermentation of animal slurries and of wastes in
abattoirs, breweries and other agro-food industries.
10. Liquid biofuels The quantities of liquid biofuels reported in this category should relate to the
quantities of biofuel and not to the total volume of liquids into which the biofuels
are blended. For the particular case of imports and exports of liquid biofuels, only
trade of quantities that have not been blended with transport fuels is concerned (i.e.
in their pure form); trade of liquid biofuels blended to transport fuels should be
reported in the oil data in Chapter 4.
The following liquid biofuels are concerned:L 304/42 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
