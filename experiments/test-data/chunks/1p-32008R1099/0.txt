of 22 October 2008
on energy statistics
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu-
nity, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251
of the Treaty (
1),
Whereas:
(1) The Community needs to have precise and timely data on
energy quantities, their forms, sources, generation, supply,
transformation and consumption, for the purpose ofmonitoring the impact and consequences of its policywork on energy.
(2) Energy statistics have traditionally been focused on energy
supply and on fossil energies. In the coming years, greater
focus is needed on increased knowledge and monitoring offinal energy consumption, renewable energy and nuclearenergy.
(3) The availability of accurate, up-to-date information on
energy is essential for assessing the impact of energy
consumption on the environment, in particular in relationto the emission of greenhouse gasses. This information isrequired by Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004concerning a mechanism for monitoring Communitygreenhouse gas emissions and for implementing the KyotoProtocol (
2).
(4) Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of
electricity produced from renewable energy sources in theinternal electricity market (
3) and Directive 2004/8/EC of
the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February2004 on the promotion of cogeneration based on a usefulheat demand in the internal energy market (
4) require
Member States to report quantitative energy data. In orderto monitor progress towards the achievement of theobjectives set in those Directives, detailed, up-to-dateenergy data are required.
(5) Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 16 December 2002 on the energy
performance of buildings (5), Directive 2006/32/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 onenergy end-use efficiency and energy services (
6) and
Directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and ofthe Council of 6 July 2005 establishing a framework for thesetting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using prod-ucts (
7) require Member States to report quantitative energy
consumption data. To monitor progress towards theachievement of the objectives set in those Directives,detailed, up-to-date energy data, as well as a better interfacebetween these energy data and related statistical surveyssuch as the population and housing censuses andtransportation data, are required.14.11.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 304/1
