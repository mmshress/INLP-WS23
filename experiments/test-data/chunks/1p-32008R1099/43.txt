Energy product Definition
10.1. Of which: biogaso-
lineThis category includes bioethanol (ethanol produced from biomass and/or the
biodegradable fraction of waste), biomethanol (methanol produced from biomass
and/or the biodegradable fraction of waste), bioETBE (ethyl-tertio-butyl-ether
produced on the basis of bioethanol; the percentage by volume of bioETBE that is
calculated as biofuel is 47 %) and bioMTBE (methyl-tertio-butyl-ether produced on
the basis of biomethanol: the percentage by volume of bioMTBE that is calculated asbiofuel is 36 %).
10.2. Of which: bio-die-
selsThis category includes bio-diesel (a methyl-ester produced from vegetable or animal
oil, of diesel quality), biodimethylether (dimethylether produced from biomass),
Fischer-Tropsch (Fischer-Tropsch produced from biomass), cold extracted bio-oil (oil
produced from oil seed through mechanical processing only) and all other liquidbiofuels which are added to, blended with or used straight as transport diesel.
10.3. Of which: other
liquid biofuelsLiquid biofuels, used directly as fuel, not included in biogasoline or bio-diesels.
5.2. List of aggregates
The following list of aggregates shall be declared for all energy products listed in the previous paragraph unless
otherwise specified.
5.2.1. Gross electricity and heat production
Electricity and heat produced from the energy products mentioned in Section 5.1 (except for charcoal and including
the total sum only of the liquid biofuels) must be declared, wherever applicable, separately:
— for main activity producer plants and for autoproducer plants,
— for electricity-only producing plants, for heat-only producing plants, and for combined heat and power (CHP)
plants.
5.2.2. Supply and transformation sectors
Quantities of energy products that are mentioned in Section 5.1 (except for hydro power, solar photovoltaic energy,
energy from tides, waves and oceans and wind energy) and used in the supply and transformation sectors must bedeclared for the following aggregates:
1. Production
2. Imports
3. Exports
4. Stock changes
A stock build is shown as a negative number and a stock draw is shown as a positive number.
5. Gross consumption6. Statistical differences7. Total transformation sector
Quantities of renewables and wastes used for the conversion of primary forms of energy to secondary (e.g.
landfill gases to electricity) or used for the transformation to derived energy products (e.g. biogas used for
blended natural gas).
