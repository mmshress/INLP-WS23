ANNEX C
MONTHLY ENERGY STATISTICS
This Annex describes the scope, units, reported period, frequency, deadline and transmission modalities for the monthly
collection of energy statistics.
Annex A applies for explanations of terms for which a specific explanation is not supplied in this Annex.
1. SOLID FUELS
1.1. Applicable energy products
Unless otherwise specified this data collection applies to all of the following energy products:
Energy product Definition
1. Hard coal Black, combustible, solid, organic, fossil sediment with a gross calorific value greater
than 24 MJ/kg in ash-free condition with the moisture content obtained at a
temperature of 30oC and a relative air humidity of 96 %.
2. Lignite Combustible, brown to black, organic fossil sediment with a gross calorific value
lower than 24 MJ/kg in ash-free condition with the moisture content obtained at a
temperature of 30oC and a relative air humidity of 96 %.
2.1. Of which: black lig-
niteLignite with a moisture content of 20 to 25 % and an ash content of 9 to 13 %. Black
lignite was formed in the secondary era. Within the Union, it is now produced only
by France from deep mining in Provence.
2.2. Of which: brown
coalLignite with a moisture content of 40 to 70 % and an ash content normally between
2 and 6 %; the latter, however, may be as high as 12 % depending on the deposit.
Brown coal was mainly formed in the tertiary era. This fuel is mostly mined in
opencast workings.
3. Peat Soft, loose to compressed, natural, combustible sediment of vegetable origin with a
high moisture content (up to 90 %), light to dark brown in colour.
This definition is without prejudice to the definition of renewable energy sources in
Directive 2001/77/EC and to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories.
4. Patent fuel Patent fuels of hard coal are artefacts of specified shape produced by hot milling
under pressure, with the addition of binding material (pitch).
5. Lignite briquettes Artefacts of even shape produced after crushing and drying of lignite, moulded
under high pressure without the addition of binders. This includes dried lignite and
lignite breeze.
6. Coke derived from
hard coalArtificial solid fuel derived from hard coal and obtained by dry distillation of the coal
in the total or partial absence of air.
Includes:— hard coke: obtained by carbonisation at high temperatures,
— semi-coke: obtained by carbonisation at low temperatures,
— gasworks coke: produced in gasworks.
7. Lignite coke Solid residue obtained by dry distillation of lignite in the absence of air.
1.2. List of aggregates
The following list of aggregates shall be declared for all energy products listed in the previous paragraph unless
otherwise specified.
