ANNEX B
ANNUAL ENERGY STATISTICS
This Annex describes the scope, units, reported period, frequency, deadline and transmission modalities for the annual
collection of energy statistics.
Annex A applies for explanations of terms for which a specific explanation is not supplied in this Annex.
1. SOLID FOSSIL FUELS AND MANUFACTURED GASES
1.1. Applicable energy products
Unless otherwise specified this data collection applies to all of the following energy products:
Energy product Definition
1. Anthracite High rank coal used for industrial and residential applications. It has generally less
than 10 % volatile matter and a high carbon content (about 90 % fixed carbon). Its
gross calorific value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but
moist basis.
2. Coking coal Bituminous coal with a quality that allows the production of a coke suitable to
support a blast furnace charge. Its gross calorific value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg
(5 700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but moist basis.
3. Other bituminous
coal
(steam coal)Coal used for steam raising purposes and includes all bituminous coal that is neither
included under coking coal nor anthracite. It is characterised by higher volatile
matter than anthracite (more than 10 %) and lower carbon content (less than 90 %
fixed carbon). Its gross calorific value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on
an ash-free but moist basis. If bituminous coal is used in coke ovens it should be
reported as coking coal.
4. Sub-bituminous
CoalRefers to non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value between 17 435 kJ/kg
(4 165 kcal/kg) and 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) containing more than 31 %
volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis.
5. Lignite/brown coal Non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value less than 17 435 kJ/kg (4 165
kcal/kg) and greater than 31 % volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis.
Oil shale and tar sands produced and combusted directly should be reported in this
category. Oil shale and tar sands used as inputs for other transformation processes
should also be reported in this category.
This includes the portion of the oil shale or tar sands consumed in the
transformation process. Shale oil and other products derived from liquefaction
should be reported on the Annual Oil Questionnaire.
6. Peat A combustible soft, porous or compressed, sedimentary deposit of plant origin with
high water content (up to 90 % in the raw state), easily cut, of light to dark brown
colour. Peat used for non-energy purposes is not included.
This definition is without prejudice to the definition of renewable energy sources in
Directive 2001/77/EC and to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories.
7. Patent fuel A composition fuel manufactured from hard coal fines with the addition of a binding
agent. The amount of patent fuel produced may, therefore, be slightly higher than the
actual amount of coal consumed in the transformation process.
8. Coke oven coke The solid product obtained from carbonisation of coal, principally coking coal, at
high temperature, it is low in moisture and volatile matter. Coke oven coke is used
mainly in the iron and steel industry acting as energy source and chemical agent.
Coke breeze and foundry coke are included in this category.
Semi-coke (a solid product obtained from carbonisation of coal at low temperature)
should be included in this category. Semi-coke is used as a domestic fuel or by the
transformation plant itself. This heading also includes coke, coke breeze and semi-
coke made from lignite/brown coal.
9. Gas coke By-product of hard coal used for production of town gas in gasworks. Gas coke is
used for heating purposes.L 304/12 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
