Annex A applies for explanations of terms for which a specific explanation is not supplied in this chapter. The
definitions and units mentioned in Chapters 1, 2, 4 and 5 apply to energy products belonging to solid fuels andmanufactured gases, natural gas, oil and petroleum products, and renewable energy and energy from waste.
3.2.1. Supply and transformation sectors
The following specific definitions apply to aggregates for electricity and heat in this chapter:
— Gross electricity production: the sum of the electrical energy production by all the generating sets concerned
(including pumped storage) measured at the output terminals of the main generators.
— Gross heat production: the total heat produced by the installation and includes the heat used by the
installation's auxiliaries which use a hot fluid (space heating, liquid fuel heating etc.) and losses in theinstallation/network heat exchanges, as well as heat from chemical processes used as a primary energy form.
— Net electricity production: the gross electricity production less the electrical energy absorbed by the
generating auxiliaries and the losses in the main generator transformers.
— Net heat production: the heat supplied to the distribution system as determined from measurements of the
outgoing and return flows.
The aggregates mentioned in the next table must be declared separately for main activity producer plants and for
autoproducer plants. Within these two types of plants, both gross and net electricity and heat production must bedeclared for electricity only, for CHP and for heat-only plants separately wherever applicable, for the followingaggregates:
1. Total production
1.1. Of which: nuclear1.2. Of which: hydro1.2.1. Of which: part of hydro produced from pumped storage
1.3. Of which: geothermal
1.4. Of which: solar1.5. Of which: tide, wave, ocean1.6. Of which: wind1.7. Of which: combustible fuels
Fuels capable of igniting or burning, i.e. reacting with oxygen to produce a significant rise in temperature
and combusted directly for the production of electricity and/or heat.
1.8. Of which: heat pumps
Heat output from heat pumps only where the heat is sold to third parties (i.e. in cases where production
occurs in the transformation sector).
1.9. Of which: electric boilers
Quantities of heat from electric boilers where the output is sold to third parties.
1.10. Of which: heat from chemical processes
Heat originating from processes without input energy, such as a chemical reaction.Excludes waste heat originating from energy-driven processes, which should be reported as heat produced
from the corresponding fuel.
1.11. Of which: other sources —electricity (please specify)
The aggregates mentioned in the next table must be declared as totals, for electricity and heat separately, wherever
applicable. For the three first aggregates in the next table, quantities should be calculated from and be compatible
with the values declared according to the previous table.
