4. OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS
4.1. Applicable energy products
Unless otherwise specified this data collection applies to all of the following energy products:
Energy product Definition
1. Crude oil Crude oil is a mineral oil of natural origin comprising a mixture of hydrocarbons and
associated impurities, such as sulphur. It exists in the liquid phase under normalsurface temperature and pressure and its physical characteristics (density, viscosity,
etc.) are highly variable. This category includes field or lease condensate recovered
from associated and non-associated gas where it is commingled with the commercial
crude oil stream.
2. NGL NGL are liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons recovered from natural gas in separation
facilities or gas processing plants. Natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane
(normal and iso-), (iso) pentane and pentanes plus (sometimes referred to as natural
gasoline or plant condensate).
3. Refinery feedstocks A refinery feedstock is a processed oil destined for further processing (e.g. straight
run fuel oil or vacuum gas oil) excluding blending. With further processing, it will be
transformed into one or more components and/or finished products. This definition
also covers returns from the petrochemical industry to the refining industry (e.g.
pyrolysis gasoline, C4 fractions, gasoil and fuel oil fractions).
4. Additives/oxygen-
atesAdditives are non-hydrocarbon compounds added to or blended with a product to
modify fuel properties (octane, cetane, cold properties, etc.):
— oxygenates, such as alcohols (methanol, ethanol), ethers (such as MTBE (methyl
tertiary butyl ether), ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether), TAME (tertiary amyl
methyl ether)),
— esters (e.g. rapeseed or dimethylester, etc.),
— chemical compounds (such as TML, TEL and detergents).
Note: quantities of additives/oxygenates (alcohols, ethers, esters and other chemical
compounds) reported in this category should relate to the quantities destined for
blending with fuels or for fuel use.
4.1. Of which: biofuels Biogasoline and bio-diesels. The definitions of Chapter 5, Renewable energy and
energy from waste, apply.
Quantities of liquid biofuels reported in this category relate to the biofuel and not to
the total volume of liquids into which the biofuels are blended.
Excludes all trade of biofuels which have not been blended with transport fuels (i.e.
in their pure form); these should be reported as per Chapter 5. The biofuels traded as
part of transport fuels should be reported in the appropriate product indicating the
biofuel portion.
5. Other hydrocarbons Synthetic crude oil from tar sands, shale oil, etc., liquids from coal liquefaction (see
Chapter 1), output of liquids from natural gas conversion into gasoline (see
Chapter 2), hydrogen and emulsified oils (e.g. orimulsion).
Excludes oil shale production, for which Chapter 1 applies.The production of shale oil (secondary product) is to be reported as ‘from other
sources’ in the ‘other hydrocarbons category’.
6. Refinery gas (not
liquefied)Refinery gas includes a mixture of non-condensible gases mainly consisting of
hydrogen, methane, ethane and olefins obtained during distillation of crude oil or
treatment of oil products (e.g. cracking) in refineries. This also includes gases which
are returned from the petrochemical industry.
7. Ethane A naturally gaseous straight-chain hydrocarbon (C
2H6) extracted from natural gas
and refinery gas streams.
8. LPG LPG are light paraffinic hydrocarbons derived from the refinery processes, crude oil
stabilisation and natural gas processing plants. They consist mainly of propane
(C3H8) and butane (C 4Hl0) or a combination of the two. They could also include
propylene, butylene, isopropylene and isobutylene. LPG are normally liquefied under
pressure for transportation and storage.14.11.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 304/33
