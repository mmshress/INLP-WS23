Energy product Definition
10. Coal tar A result of the destructive distillation of bituminous coal. Coal tar is the liquid by-
product of the distillation of coal to make coke in the coke oven process or it is
produced from brown coal (low-temperature tar). Coal tar can be further distilled
into different organic products (e.g. benzene, toluene, naphthalene), which normally
would be reported as a feedstock to the petrochemical industry.
11. BKB
(brown coal bri-
quettes)BKB is a composition fuel manufactured from lignite/brown coal, produced by
briquetting under high pressure without the addition of a binding agent. These
figures include peat briquettes, dried lignite fines and dust.
12. Gasworks gas Covers all types of gases produced in public utility or private plants, whose main
purpose is manufacture, transport and distribution of gas. It includes gas produced
by carbonisation (including gas produced by coke ovens and transferred to gasworks
gas), by total gasification with or without enrichment with oil products (LPG,
residual fuel oil, etc.), and by reforming and simple mixing of gases and/or air,
reported under the rows ‘from other sources’. Under the transformation sector
identify amounts of gasworks gas transferred to blended natural gas which will bedistributed and consumed through the natural gas grid.
The production of other coal gases (i.e. coke oven gas, blast furnace gas and oxygen
steel furnace gas) should be reported in the columns concerning such gases, and not
as production of gasworks gas. The coal gases transferred to gasworks plants should
then be reported (in their own column) in the transformation sector in the gasworks
plants row. The total amount of gasworks gas resulting from transfers of other coal
gases should appear in the production line for gasworks gas.
13. Coke oven gas Obtained as a by-product of the manufacture of coke oven coke for the production
of iron and steel.
14. Blast furnace gas Produced during the combustion of coke in blast furnaces in the iron and steel
industry. It is recovered and used as a fuel partly within the plant and partly in othersteel industry processes or in power stations equipped to burn it. The quantity of fuel
should be reported on a gross calorific value basis.
15. Oxygen steel furnace
gasBy-product of the production of steel in an oxygen furnace, recovered on leaving the
furnace. The gas is also known as converter gas, LD gas or BOS gas.
16. Hard coal The term ‘hard coal’ refers to coal of gross calorific value greater than 23 865 kJ/kg
(5 700 kcal/kg) on an ashfree but moist basis and with a mean random reflectance of
vitrinite of at least 0,6. Hard coal comprises all energy products from 1 to 3 together
(anthracite, coking coal and other bituminous coal).
1.2. List of aggregates
The following list of aggregates shall be declared for all energy products listed in the previous paragraph unless
otherwise specified.
Annex A applies for explanations of terms for which a specific explanation is not supplied in this Annex.
1.2.1. Supply and transformation sectors
1. Production
1.1. Of which: underground
Applicable only for anthracite, coking coal, other bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal and lignite/brown
coal.
1.2. Of which: surface
Applicable only for anthracite, coking coal, other bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal and lignite/brown
coal.
2. From other sources
This consists of two components:— recovered slurries, middlings and other low-grade coal products, which cannot be classified
according to type of coal. This includes coal recovered from waste piles and other waste receptacles,
— supplies of fuel of which production is covered in other fuel energy balances, but for which
consumption will occur in the coal energy balance.14.11.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 304/13
