8.4. Of which: combined cycle
8.5. Of which: other
To be specified if declared.
9. Peak load10. Available capacity at time of peak11. Date and time of peak load occurrence
3.3.2. Net maximum electrical capacity of combustible fuels
Net maximum electrical capacity of combustible fuels must be declared for both main activity producers and
autoproducers, and separately for each type of single-fired or multi-fired plant mentioned in the next table.
Indications on which type of fuel is used as primary and alternate fuels must be added for all cases of multi-firedplants.
1. Single fuel fired:
1.1. Fired with coal or coal products
Includes coke oven gas, blast furnace and oxygen steel furnace gas capacity.
1.2. Fired with liquid fuels
Includes refinery gas capacity.
1.3. Fired with natural gas
Includes gasworks gas capacity.
1.4. Fired with peat
1.5. Fired with combustible renewables and wastes
2. Multi-fired, solids and liquids3. Multi-fired, solids and natural gas4. Multi-fired, liquids and natural gas5. Multi-fired, solids, liquids and natural gas
Multi-fired systems include only units which can burn more than one fuel type on a continuous basis. Stations
which have separate units using different fuels should be divided into the appropriate single-fuel categories.
3.4. Units of measurement
1. Energy quantities Electricity: GWh
Heat: TJSolid fuels and manufactured gases: the units of measurement in Chapter 1 of this
Annex apply.
Natural gas: the units of measurement in Chapter 2 of this Annex apply.
Oil and petroleum products: the units of measurement in Chapter 4 of this Annex
apply.
Renewables and waste: the units of measurement in Chapter 5 of this Annex apply.
2. Capacity Electrical generation capacity: MWe
Heat generation capacity: MWt
3.5. Derogations and exemptions
France has a derogation for reporting the aggregates relating to heat. That derogation shall lapse as soon as France is
able to forward this report and, at all events, no more than four years after the date of entry into force of thisRegulation.L 304/32 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
