Energy product Definition
9. Naphtha Naphtha is a feedstock destined for either the petrochemical industry (e.g. ethylene
manufacture or aromatics production) or for gasoline production by reforming or
isomerisation within the refinery.
Naphtha comprises material in the 30oC and 210oC distillation range or part of this
range.
10. Motor gasoline Motor gasoline consists of a mixture of light hydrocarbons distilling between 35oC
and 215oC. It is used as a fuel for land based spark ignition engines. Motor gasoline
may include additives, oxygenates and octane enhancers, including lead compounds
such as TEL and TML.
Includes motor gasoline blending components (excluding additives/oxygenates), e.g.
alkylates, isomerate, reformate, cracked gasoline destined for use as finished motor
gasoline.
10.1. Of which: biogaso-
lineThe definitions of Chapter 5, Renewable energy and energy from waste, apply.
11. Aviation gasoline Motor spirit prepared especially for aviation piston engines, with an octane number
suited to the engine, a freezing point of - 60oC and a distillation range usually within
the limits of 30oC and 180oC.
12. Gasoline type jet fuel
(naphtha type jet
fuel or JP4)This includes all light hydrocarbon oils for use in aviation turbine power units,
distilling between 100oC and 250oC. They are obtained by blending kerosenes and
gasoline or naphthas in such a way that the aromatic content does not exceed 25 %
in volume, and the vapour pressure is between 13,7 kPa and 20,6 kPa.
13. Kerosene type jet
fuelDistillate used for aviation turbine power units. It has the same distillation
characteristics between 150oC and 300oC (generally not above 250oC) and flash
point as kerosene. In addition, it has particular specifications (such as freezing point)
which are established by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
Includes kerosene blending components.
14. Other kerosene Refined petroleum distillate used in sectors other than aircraft transport. It distils
between 150oC and 300oC.
15. Gas/diesel oil (distil-
late fuel oil)Gas/diesel oil is primarily a medium distillate distilling between 180oC and 380oC.
Includes blending components. Several grades are available depending on uses.
15.1. Of which: transport
dieselOn-road diesel oil for diesel compression ignition (cars, trucks, etc.), usually of low
sulphur content.
15.1.1. From 15.1, of
which: bio-dieselsThe definitions of Chapter 5, Renewable energy and energy from waste, apply.
15.2 Of which: heating
and other gasoilLight heating oil for industrial and commercial uses, marine diesel and diesel used in
rail traffic, other gas oil, including heavy gas oils which distil between 380oC and
540oC and which are used as petrochemical feedstocks.
16. Fuel oil All residual (heavy) fuel oils (including those obtained by blending). Kinematic
viscosity is above 10 cSt at 80oC. The flash point is always above 50oC and density
is always more than 0,90 kg/l.
16.1. Of which: low
sulphur contentHeavy fuel oil with sulphur content lower than 1 %.
16.2. Of which: high
sulphur contentHeavy fuel oil with sulphur content of 1 % or higher.L 304/34 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
