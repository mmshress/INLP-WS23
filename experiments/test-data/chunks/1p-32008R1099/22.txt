2.2.6. Gas storage capacities
1. Name
Name of the site of the storage facility.
2. Type
Type of storage, such as depleted gas field, salt cavern, etc.
3. Working capacity
Total gas storage capacity, minus the cushion gas. The cushion gas is the total volume of gas required as a
permanent inventory to maintain adequate underground storage reservoir pressures and deliverability rates
throughout the output cycle.
4. Peak output
Maximum rate at which gas can be withdrawn from the concerned storage.
2.3. Units of measurement
1. Energy quantities Unless indicated differently, quantities of natural gas are declared by its energy
content, i.e. in TJ, based on the gross calorific value.
Where physical quantities are required, the unit is in 10
6m3assuming reference gas
conditions (15oC, 101,325 kPa).
2. Calorific values KJ/m3, assuming reference gas conditions (15oC, 101,325 kPa).
3. Storage working
capacity106m3, assuming reference gas conditions (15oC, 101,325 kPa).
4. Peak output 106m3/day, assuming reference gas conditions (15oC, 101,325 kPa).
2.4. Derogations and exemptions
Not applicable.
3. ELECTRICITY AND HEAT
3.1. Applicable energy products
This chapter covers heat and electricity.
3.2. List of aggregates
The following list of aggregates shall be declared for all energy products listed in the previous paragraph unless
otherwise specified.L 304/22 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
