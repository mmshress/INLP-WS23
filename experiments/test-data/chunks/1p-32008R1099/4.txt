2. Every reasonable effort shall be undertaken to ensure
coherence between energy data declared in accordance withAnnex B and data declared in accordance with CommissionDecision 2005/166/EC of 10 February 2005 laying down therules for implementing Decision No 280/2004/EC of theEuropean Parliament and of the Council concerning a mechan-ism for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions andfor implementing the Kyoto Protocol (
1).
3. For the purposes of this Regulation, the following quality
assessment dimensions shall apply to the data to be transmitted:
(a) ‘relevance’ shall refer to the degree to which statistics meet
current and potential needs of the users;
(b) ‘accuracy’ shall refer to the closeness of estimates to the
unknown true values;
(c) ‘timeliness’ shall refer to the delay between the availability
of the information and the event or phenomenon itdescribes;
(d) ‘punctuality’ shall refer to the delay between the date of the
release of the data and the target date when it should havebeen delivered;
(e) ‘accessibility’ and ‘clarity’ shall refer to the conditions and
modalities by which users can obtain, use and interpretdata;
(f) ‘comparability’ shall refer to the measurement of the impact
of differences in applied statistical concepts and measure-ment tools and procedures where statistics are comparedbetween geographical areas, sectoral domains or over time;
(g) ‘coherence ’shall refer to the adequacy of the data to be
reliably combined in different ways and for various uses.
4. Every five years, Member States shall provide the Commis-
sion (Eurostat) with a report on the quality of the datatransmitted as well as on any methodological changes that havebeen made.
5. Within six months of receipt of a request from the
Commission (Eurostat), and in order to allow it to assess thequality of the data transmitted, Member States shall send to theCommission (Eurostat) a report containing any relevantinformation concerning the implementation of this Regulation.
Article 7
Time reference and frequency
Member States shall compile all data specified in this Regulation
from the beginning of the calendar year following the adoptionof this Regulation, and shall transmit them from then onwards
with the frequencies laid down in Article 4(1).
Article 8
Annual nuclear statistics
The Commission (Eurostat) shall, in cooperation with the nuclear
energy sector in the EU, define a set of annual nuclear statistics
which shall be reported and disseminated from 2009 onwards,
that year being the first reported period, without prejudice toconfidentiality, where it is necessary, and avoiding any duplica-tion of data collection, while at the same time keepingproduction costs low and the reporting burden reasonable.
The set of annual nuclear statistics shall be established and may
be modified in accordance with the regulatory procedure withscrutiny referred to in Article 11(2).
Article 9
Renewable energy statistics and final energy consumption
statistics
1. With a view to improving the quality of renewable energy
and final energy consumption statistics, the Commission(Eurostat), in collaboration with the Member States, shall makesure that these statistics are comparable, transparent, detailed andflexible by:
(a) reviewing the methodology used to generate renewable
energy statistics in order to make available additional,pertinent, detailed statistics on each renewable energysource, annually and in a cost-effective manner. The
Commission (Eurostat) shall present and disseminate the
statistics generated from 2010 (reference year) onwards;
(b) reviewing and determining the methodology used at
national and Community level to generate final energyconsumption statistics (sources, variables, quality, costs)based on the current situation, existing studies andfeasibility pilot studies, as well as cost-benefit analyses yetto be conducted, and evaluating the findings of the pilotstudies and cost-benefit analyses with a view to establishingbreakdown keys for final energies by sector and mainenergy uses and gradually integrating the resulting elementsinto the statistics from 2012 (reference year) onwards.
2. The set of renewable energy statistics may be modified in
accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referredto in Article 11(2).
3. The set of final energy consumption statistics shall be
established and may be modified in accordance with theregulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 11(2).L 304/4 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
