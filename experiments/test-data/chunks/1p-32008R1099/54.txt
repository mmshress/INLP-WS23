— Leaded motor gasoline: motor gasoline with TEL and/or TML added to enhance octane rating.
‘Other products’ include both the quantities that correspond to the definition in Annex B Chapter 4 and in addition
the quantities of white spirit and SBP, lubricants, bitumen and paraffin waxes; these products must not be declaredseparately.
3.2. List of aggregates
The following list of aggregates shall be declared for all energy products listed in the previous paragraph unless
otherwise specified.
3.2.1. Supply sector
The following table applies only to crude oil, NGL, refinery feedstocks, additives/oxygenates, biofuels and other
hydrocarbons only:
1. Indigenous production
Not applicable for refinery feedstocks.
2. From other sources
Additives, biofuels and other hydrocarbons, the production of which has already been covered in other fuel
balances.
Not applicable for crude oil, NGL and refinery feedstocks.
3. Backflows from petrochemical sector
Finished or semi-finished products which are returned from final consumers to refineries for processing,
blending or sale.
They are usually by-products of petrochemical manufacturing. Only applicable for refinery feedstocks.
4. Products transferred
Imported petroleum products which are reclassified as feedstocks for further processing in the refinery,
without delivery to final consumers.
Only applicable for refinery feedstocks.
5. Imports and exports
Includes quantities of crude oil and products imported or exported under processing agreements (i.e.
refining on account). Crude oil and NGLs should be reported as coming from the country of ultimate
origin; refinery feedstocks and finished products should be reported as coming from the country of last
consignment.
Includes any gas liquids (e.g. LPG) extracted during the regasification of imported liquefied natural gas and
petroleum products imported or exported directly by the petrochemical industry.
Note: all trade of biofuels which have not been blended with transport fuels (i.e. in their pure form) should
be reported in the Renewables Questionnaire.
6. Direct use
Crude oil, NGL and other hydrocarbons used directly without being processed in petroleum refineries.Includes crude oil burned for electricity generation.
7. Stock changes
A stock build is shown as a positive number and a stock draw is shown as a negative number.
8. Calculated refinery intake
Total amount of product calculated to have entered the refinery process. It is defined as:indigenous production + from other sources + backflows from industry + products transferred + imports −
exports −direct use −stock changes.
9. Statistical differences
Defined as the calculated refinery intake minus the observed one.
10. Observed refinery intake
Amounts measured as input to refineries.L 304/54 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
