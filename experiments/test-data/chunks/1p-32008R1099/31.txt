3.3.1. Net maximum electrical capacity and peak load
The capacity should be reported at 31 December of the relevant reported year.
Includes electrical capacity of both electricity (only) and CHP plants.
The net maximum electrical capacity is the sum of the net maximum capacities of all stations taken individually
throughout a given period of operation. The period of operation assumed for present purposes is continuousrunning: in practice 15 hours or more per day. The net maximum capacity is the maximum power assumed to besolely active power that can be supplied, continuously, with all plant running, at the point of outlet to the network.The peak load is defined as the highest value of the power absorbed or supplied by a network or combination ofnetworks within the country.
