11. Refinery losses
The difference between refinery intake (observed) and gross refinery output. Losses may occur during the
distillation processes due to evaporation. Reported losses are positive. There may be volumetric gains but
no gains in mass.
12. Production of oxygenates
That part of production or from other sources which is ethers such as MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether),
TAME (tertiary amyl methyl ether), alcohols such as ethanol and esters and which are used for blending
into gasoline and gasoil.
The following table does not apply to refinery feedstocks nor to additives/oxygenates:
1. Primary product receipts
Includes quantities of indigenous or imported crude oil (including condensate) and indigenous NGL used
directly without being processed in a petroleum refinery and quantities of backflows from the
petrochemical industry which, although not primary fuel, are used directly.
2. Gross refinery output
Production of finished products at a refinery or blending plant.Excludes refinery losses, but includes refinery fuel.
3. Recycled products
Finished products which pass a second time through the marketing network, after having been once
delivered to final consumers (e.g. used lubricants which are reprocessed). These quantities should be
distinguished from petrochemical backflows.
4. Refinery fuel
Petroleum products consumed in support of the operation of a refinery.Excludes products used by oil companies outside the refining process, e.g. bunkers or oil tankers.Includes fuels used for the production at the refineries of electricity and heat sold.
5. Imports and exports
6. International marine bunkers7. Interproduct transfers
Quantities reclassified either because their specification has changed or because they are blended into
another product.
A negative entry for one product is compensated by a positive entry (or several entries) for one or several
products and vice versa; the total net effect should be zero.
8. Products transferred
Imported petroleum products which are reclassified as feedstocks for further processing in the refinery,
without delivery to final consumers.
9. Stock changes
A stock build is shown as a positive number and a stock draw is shown as a negative number.
10. Calculated gross inland deliveries
This is defined as:primary product receipts + gross refinery output + recycled products −refinery fuel + imports −exports −
international marine bunkers + interproduct transfers −products transferred −stock changes.
11. Statistical difference
Defined as the calculated gross inland delivery minus the observed one.
12. Observed gross inland deliveries
The observed delivery of finished petroleum products from primary sources (e.g. refineries, blending
plants, etc.) to the inland market.
This figure may differ from the calculated figure due, for example, to differences in coverage and/or
differences of definition in different reporting systems.
