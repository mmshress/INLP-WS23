(6) The Green Papers of the Commission of 22 June 2005 on
Energy Efficiency and of 8 March 2006 on a European
Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energydiscuss EU energy policies for which the availability of EUenergy statistics are required, including for the purpose ofestablishing a European Energy Market Observatory.
(7) The establishment of a public domain energy forecast
model, as called for by the European Parliament in its
Resolution of 14 December 2006 on a European Strategyfor Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy (
1) requires
detailed, up-to-date energy data.
(8) In the coming years, greater attention should be paid to the
security of supply of the most important fuels and more
timely and more accurate data at EU level is needed toanticipate and coordinate EU solutions to possible supplycrises.
(9) The liberalisation of the energy market and its growing
complexity make it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable,
timely energy data in the absence, in particular, of a legalbasis concerning the provision of such data.
(10) In order for the energy statistics system to assist political
decision-making by the European Union and its Member
States and promote public debate which includes citizens, itmust afford guarantees of comparability, transparency,flexibility and ability to evolve. Thus, in the near future,
statistics on nuclear energy should be incorporated and
relevant data concerning renewable energy should bedeveloped more. Similarly, with regard to energy efficiency,the availability of detailed statistics on habitat and transportwould be extremely useful.
(11) The production of Community statistics is governed by the
rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of
17 February 1997 on Community Statistics (2).
(12) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely establishing a
common framework for the production, transmission,
evaluation and dissemination of comparable energystatistics in the Community cannot be sufficiently achievedby the Member States and can therefore be better achievedat Community level, the Community may adopt measures,
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in
Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle ofproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulationdoes not go beyond what is necessary to achieve thatobjective.
(13) In the production and dissemination of Community
statistics under this Regulation, the national andCommunity statistical authorities should take account of
the principles set out in the European Statistics Code ofPractice, which was adopted on 24 February 2005 by theStatistical Programme Committee, established by CouncilDecision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (
3) and attached to the
Recommendation of the Commission on the independence,integrity and accountability of the national and Communitystatistical authorities.
(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this
Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council
Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down theprocedures for the exercise of implementing powersconferred on the Commission (
4).
(15) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commis-
sion to modify the list of data sources, the national statistics
and the applicable clarifications or definitions as well as thetransmission arrangements and to establish and modify theannual nuclear statistics, once incorporated, to modify therenewable energy statistics, once incorporated, and toestablish and modify the final energy consumption
statistics. Since those measures are of general scope and
are designed to amend non-essential elements of thisRegulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordancewith the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for inArticle 5(a) of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(16) It is necessary to provide that the Commission may grant
exemptions or derogations to Member States from those
aspects of the energy data collection that would lead to anexcessive burden on respondents. The exemptions orderogations should be granted only upon receipt of aproper justification which indicates the present situationand the excessive burden transparently. The period forwhich they remain in force should be limited to the shortesttime necessary.
(17) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in
accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme
Committee,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
