Imports/exports
For geographical definitions see ‘Geographical notes’ section.
Unless specified differently, ‘imports’ refer to ultimate origin (the country in which the energy product was produced)
for use in the country and ‘exports’ to the ultimate country of consumption of the produced energy product.
Amounts are considered as imported or exported when they have crossed the political boundaries of the country,
whether customs clearance has taken place or not.
Where no origin or destination can be reported ‘other ’may be used.
Statistical differences may arise if only total import and export are available on the above basis, while the geographical
breakdown is based on a different survey, source or concept. In this case, differences shall be included under ‘other ’.
International marine bunkers
Quantities of fuels delivered to ships of all flags that are engaged in international navigation. The international
navigation may take place at sea, on inland lakes and waterways, and in coastal waters. Excluded is:
— consumption by ships engaged in domestic navigation. The domestic/international split should be determined
on the basis of port of departure and port of arrival, and not by the flag or nationality of the ship,
— consumption by fishing vessels,
— consumption by military forces.
Stock changes
The difference between the opening stock level and closing stock level for stocks held on national territory.
Gross consumption (calculated)
Calculated value, defined as:indigenous production + from other sources + imports −exports −international marine bunkers + stock changes
Gross consumption (observed)
The quantity actually recorded in surveys of end-use sectors.
Statistical differences
Calculated value, defined as:calculated gross consumption —observed gross consumption.
Includes changes in stocks at final consumers when this cannot be specified as part of the ‘stock changes’.
Reasons for any major differences should be stated.
