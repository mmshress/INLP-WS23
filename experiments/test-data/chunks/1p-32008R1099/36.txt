2.3. Of which: from renewables
Includes biofuels which are for blending with transport fuels.Production is declared as per Chapter 5, while amounts for blending are declared here.
3. Backflows from petrochemical sector
Finished or semi-finished products which are returned from final consumers to refineries for processing,
blending or sale. They are usually by-products of petrochemical manufacturing.
Only applicable for refinery feedstocks.
4. Products transferred
Imported petroleum products which are reclassified as feedstocks for further processing in the refinery,
without delivery to final consumers.
Only applicable for refinery feedstocks.
5. Imports and exports
Includes quantities of crude oil and products imported or exported under processing agreements (i.e.
refining on account). Crude oil and NGLs should be reported as coming from the country of ultimate
origin; refinery feedstocks and finished products should be reported as coming from the country of last
consignment.
Includes any gas liquids (e.g. LPG) extracted during the regasification of imported liquefied natural gas and
petroleum products imported or exported directly by the petrochemical industry.
Note: all trade of biofuels which have not been blended with transport fuels (i.e. in their pure form) should
be reported in the Renewables Questionnaire.
Re-exports of oil imported for processing within bonded areas should be included as an export of product
from the processing country to the final destination.
6. Direct use
Crude oil, NGL, additives and oxygenates (and the part which are biofuels), and other hydrocarbons used
directly without being processed in petroleum refineries.
Includes crude oil burned for electricity generation.
7. Stock changes
A stock build is shown as a negative number and a stock draw is shown as a positive number.
8. Calculated refinery intake
Total amount of product calculated to have entered the refinery process. It is defined as:indigenous production + from other sources + backflows from industry + products transferred + imports −
exports −direct use + stock changes
9. Statistical differences
Defined as the calculated refinery intake minus the observed one.
10. Observed refinery intake
Amounts measured as input to refineries
11. Refinery losses
The difference between refinery intake (observed) and gross refinery output. Losses may occur during the
distillation processes due to evaporation. Reported losses are positive. There may be volumetric gains but
no gains in mass.
12. Opening and closing total stocks on national territory
All stocks on national territory, including stocks held by governments, by major consumers or by
stockholding organisations, stocks held on board incoming ocean vessels, stocks held in bonded areas and
stocks held for others, whether under bilateral government agreement or not. Opening and closing refers
to the first and to the last day of the reporting period respectively.
13. Net calorific value
Production, imports and exports, and overall average.L 304/36 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
