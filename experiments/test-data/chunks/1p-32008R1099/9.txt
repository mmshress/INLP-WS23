Gasworks/gasification works
Quantities consumed as energy at gasworks and coal gasification plants.
Blast furnaces
Quantities consumed as energy at blast furnaces.
Coal liquefaction
Quantities consumed as energy at coal liquefaction plants.
Petroleum refineries
Quantities consumed as energy at petroleum refineries.
Oil and gas extraction
Quantities consumed as fuel in the oil and gas extraction process and in natural gas processing plants.Excludes pipeline losses (to be reported as distribution losses) and energy quantities used to operate pipelines (to be
reported in the transport sector).
Total final consumption
Defined (calculated) as:= total non-energy use + final energy consumption (industry + transport + other sectors)It excludes deliveries for transformation, use by the energy producing industries, and distribution losses.
Non-energy use
Energy products used as raw materials in the different sectors; that is, not consumed as a fuel or transformed into
another fuel.
2.3. Energy end-use specification
Final energy consumption
Total energy consumption in industry, transport and other sectors.
Industry sector
This refers to fuel quantities consumed by the industrial undertaking in support of its primary activities.For heat-only or CHP plants, only quantities of fuels consumed for the production of heat used by the plant itself are
applicable. Quantities of fuels consumed for the production of heat that is sold, and for the production of electricity,
should be reported under the appropriate transformation sector.
