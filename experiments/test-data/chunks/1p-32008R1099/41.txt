5. RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY FROM WASTE
5.1. Applicable energy products
Unless otherwise specified this data collection applies to all of the following energy products:
Energy product Definition
1. Hydro power Potential and kinetic energy of water converted into electricity in hydroelectric
plants. Pumped storage must be included. Production must be reported for plant
sizes of < 1 MW, 1 to < 10 MW, ≥10 MW and from pumped storage.
2. Geothermal Energy available as heat emitted from within the earth's crust, usually in the form of
hot water or steam. This energy production is the difference between the enthalpy of
the fluid produced in the production borehole and that of the fluid eventually
disposed of. It is exploited at suitable sites:
— for electricity generation using dry steam or high enthalpy brine after flashing,
— directly as heat for district heating, agriculture etc.14.11.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 304/41
