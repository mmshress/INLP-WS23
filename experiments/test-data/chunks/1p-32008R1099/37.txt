The following table applies only to finished products (refinery gas, ethane, LPG, naphtha, motor gasoline, aviation
gasoline, gasoline type jet fuel, kerosene type jet fuel, other kerosene, gas/diesel oil, low and high sulphur fuel oil,white spirit and SBP, lubricants, bitumen, paraffin waxes, petroleum coke and other products). Crude oil and NGLused for direct burn should be included in deliveries of finished products and interproduct transfers:
1. Primary product receipts
Includes quantities of indigenous or imported crude oil (including condensate) and indigenous NGL used
directly without being processed in a petroleum refinery and quantities of backflows from the
petrochemical industry which, although not primary fuel, are used directly.
2. Gross refinery output
Production of finished products at a refinery or blending plant.Excludes refinery losses, but includes refinery fuel.
3. Recycled products
Finished products which pass a second time through the marketing network, after having been once
delivered to final consumers (e.g. used lubricants which are reprocessed). These quantities should be
distinguished from petrochemical backflows.
4. Refinery fuel
Petroleum products consumed in support of the operation of a refinery.Excludes products used by oil companies outside the refining process, e.g. bunkers or oil tankers.Includes fuels used for the production at the refineries of electricity and heat sold.
4.1. Of which: used for electricity generation
Amounts used to generate electricity in plants at refineries.
4.2. Of which: used for CHP production
Amounts used in CHP plants at refineries.
5. Imports and exports
6. International marine bunkers
7. Interproduct transfers
Quantities reclassified either because their specification has changed or because they are blended into
another product.
A negative entry for one product is compensated by a positive entry (or several entries) for one or several
products and vice versa; the total net effect should be zero.
8. Products transferred
Imported petroleum products which are reclassified as feedstocks for further processing in the refinery,
without delivery to final consumers.
9. Stock changes
A stock build is shown as a negative number and a stock draw is shown as a positive number.
10. Calculated gross inland deliveries
This is defined as:primary product receipts + gross refinery output + recycled products −refinery fuel + imports −exports −
international marine bunkers + interproduct transfers −products transferred + stock changes
11. Statistical difference
Defined as the calculated gross inland delivery minus the observed one.
12. Observed gross inland deliveries
The observed delivery of finished petroleum products from primary sources (e.g. refineries, blending
plants, etc.) to the inland market.
This figure may differ from the calculated figure due, for example, to differences in coverage and/or
differences of definition in different reporting systems.
12.1. Of which: gross deliveries to the petrochemical sector
Quantities of fuels delivered to the petrochemical sector.14.11.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 304/37
