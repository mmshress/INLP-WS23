Energy product Definition
17. White spirit and SBP Refined distillate intermediates with a distillation in the naphtha/kerosene range.
They are subdivided as:
— Industrial spirit (SBP): light oils distilling between 30oC and 200oC. There are
7 or 8 grades of industrial spirit, depending on the position of the cut in the
distillation range. The grades are defined according to the temperaturedifference between the 5 % volume and 90 % volume distillation points (which
is not more than 60
oC).
— White spirit: industrial spirit with a flash point above 30oC. The distillation
range of white spirit is 135oC to 200oC.
18. Lubricants Hydrocarbons produced from distillate by-product; they are mainly used to reduce
friction between bearing surfaces.
Includes all finished grades of lubricating oil, from spindle oil to cylinder oil, and
those used in greases, motor oils and all grades of lubricating oil base stocks.
19. Bitumen Solid, semi-solid or viscous hydrocarbon with a colloidal structure, being brown to
black in colour, obtained as a residue in the distillation of crude oil, by vacuumdistillation of oil residues from atmospheric distillation. Bitumen is often referred to
as asphalt and is primarily used for construction of roads and for roofing material.
Includes fluidised and cut back bitumen.
20. Paraffin waxes These are saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. These waxes are residues extracted when
dewaxing lubricant oils. They have a crystalline structure which is more-or-less fine
according to the grade. Their main characteristics are as follows: they are colourless,odourless and translucent, with a melting point above 45
oC.
21. Petroleum coke Black solid by-product, obtained mainly by cracking and carbonising petroleum
derived feedstock, vacuum bottoms, tar and pitches in processes such as delayed
coking or fluid coking. It consists mainly of carbon (90 to 95 %) and has a low ash
content. It is used as a feedstock in coke ovens for the steel industry, for heatingpurposes, for electrode manufacture and for production of chemicals. The two most
important qualities are ‘green coke’ and ‘calcinated coke’.
Includes ‘catalyst coke’ deposited on the catalyst during refining processes; this coke
is not recoverable and is usually burned as refinery fuel.
22. Other products All products not specifically mentioned above, for example: tar and sulphur.
Includes aromatics (e.g. BTX or benzene, toluene and xylene) and olefins (e.g.
propylene) produced within refineries.
4.2. List of aggregates
The following list of aggregates shall be declared for all energy products listed in the previous paragraph unless
otherwise specified.
4.2.1. Supply and transformation sectors
The following table applies to crude oil, NGL, refinery feedstocks, additives, biofuels and other hydrocarbons only:
1. Indigenous production
Not applicable for refinery feedstocks and for biofuels.
2. From other sources additives, biofuels and other hydrocarbons, the production of which has already been
covered in other fuel balances.
Not applicable for crude oil, NGL and refinery feedstocks.
2.1. Of which: from coal
Includes liquids produced from coal liquefaction plants, liquid output from coke ovens.
2.2. Of which: from natural gas
The manufacture of synthetic gasoline may require natural gas as feedstock. The amount of gas for
methanol manufacture is declared according to Chapter 2, while the receipts of methanol are declared here.14.11.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 304/35
