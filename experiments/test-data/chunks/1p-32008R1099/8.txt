Autoproducer heat plants
Quantities of fuels that correspond to the quantity of heat sold.
Patent fuel plants
Quantities used to produce fuels.Quantities used for heating and operation of equipment should not be declared here, but declared as consumption in
the energy sector.
Coke ovens
Quantities used in coke ovens.Quantities used for heating and operation of equipment should not be declared here, but declared as consumption in
the energy sector.
BKB/PB plants
Quantities of lignite or brown coal used to produce brown coal briquettes (BKB) or of peat to produce peat briquettes
(PB).
Quantities used for heating and operation of equipment should not be declared here, but declared as consumption in
the energy sector.
Gasworks
Quantities used to produce gas in gasworks and coal gasification plants.Quantities used as a fuel for heating and operation of equipment should not be included here, but declared as
consumption in the energy sector.
Blast furnace
Quantities of coking coal and/or bituminous coal (generally referred to as PCI) and coke oven coke transformed in
blast furnaces.
Quantities used as a fuel for heating and operation of blast furnaces (e.g. blast furnaces gas) should not be included
here, but declared as consumption in the energy sector.
Coal liquefaction
Quantities of fuel used to produce synthetic oil.
Petroleum refineries
Quantities used to produce petroleum products.
Quantities used as a fuel for heating and operation of equipment should not be declared here, but declared as
consumption in the energy sector.
Not elsewhere specified â€”transformation
Quantities used for transformation activities not included elsewhere. If used, what is included under this heading
should be explained in the report.
2.2. Energy sector and final consumption
Total energy sector
Quantities consumed by the energy industry to support the extraction (mining, oil and gas production) or plant
operations of transformation activities.
Excludes quantities of fuels transformed into another energy form (which should be reported under the
transformation sector) or used in support of the operation of oil, gas and coal slurry pipelines (which should be
reported in the transport sector).
Includes the manufacture of chemical materials for atomic fission and fusion and the products of these processes.
Electricity, CHP and heat plants
Quantities consumed as energy at electricity plants, combined heat and power plants (CHP) and heat plants.
Coal mines
Quantities consumed as energy to support the extraction and preparation of coal within the coal mining industry.Coal burned in pithead power stations should be reported in the transformation sector.
Patent fuel plants
Quantities consumed as energy at patent fuel plants.
Coke ovens
Quantities consumed as energy at coking plants.
BKB/PB plants
