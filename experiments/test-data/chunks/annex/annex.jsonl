The same meeting shall fix the terms of issue of the new shares or of the increase in nominal value of the existing shares, or shall delegate its powers for this purpose to the Board of Directors.Increases of capital may be effected by creation of either ordinary shares or preference shares which confer certain advantages over other shares or prior rights either to the profits or to the assets of the company or to both.Whenever the capital is increased by the issue of shares for cash, an equal number of Class A and Class B shares shall be issued, so that the number of Class A shares is always the same as that of Class B shares.Shareholders, whether natural or legal persons, who are nationals of foreign countries signatories of the Euratom Treaty shall have a preferential right to subscribe in proportion to the nominal amount of their shares for new Class B shares that are to be issued, which right shall be exercised in such manner and within such time as the Board of Directors shall determine.This right shall be freely transferable and negotiable subject to Article 11, those shareholders whose shareholdings are such that they are unable to acquire a new share or an exact number of shares shall be entitled to combine to exercise their rights but in no case shall a joint subscription result therefrom.Resolutions of an extraordinary general meeting concerning any increase or reduction of capital referred to in this Article shall not, in any case or for any reason whatsoever, derogate from the principle enunciated in the first paragraph of Article 7.Article 9The amount of the shares subscribed shall be payable, either at the seat of the company or at any other place appointed for the purpose, as follows:Notice of calls shall in each case be served on shareholders by registered letter, with advice of delivery, one month before the time fixed for such payment.Subscriptions for shares upon which the payment due at the time of subscription has not been made may be deemed void if no action has been taken within eight days after service of notice by registered letter.Any share certificate not duly marked to show that payments due in respect thereof have been paid shall cease to be negotiable and no dividend shall be paid thereon.Shareholders, intermediate transferees and subscribers shall be jointly and severally liable for the amount of the share. However, any subscriber or shareholder who has transferred his certificate shall, two years after the transfer, cease to be liable for calls not yet made.If the sum called in respect of a share is not paid at the times aforesaid, interest shall fall due at the rate of 7\u00a0% per annum for each day of delay in payment without the need for action at law.If the amounts due on shares are not paid within the period specified at the time of the call, the company may, in the case of Class B shares, eight days after serving notice upon the defaulting shareholder by registered letter requiring him to pay the sums due from him by way of principal and interest, notify him that the company will cause the sale of the shares upon which the calls have not been paid.If the company has notified its intention to sell shares which have not been paid up, the numbers of such shares shall, if no action has been taken within eight days following the notification, be published in the form of a notice appearing in a publication which carries legal notices in the place at which the company has its seat.

Only holders of Class B shares shall be permitted to bid if the shares can be sold at a price which ensures that the company will receive the whole of the sums due from the defaulting shareholder. If no bid reaches that figure, bidding shall be open to persons who are not members of the company, provided they are nationals of foreign countries signatories of the Euratom Treaty.
