====================
(6) The Green Papers of the Commission of 22 June 2005 on
Energy Efficiency and of 8 March 2006 on a European
Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energydiscuss EU energy policies for which the availability of EUenergy statistics are required, including for the purpose ofestablishing a European Energy Market Observatory.
(7) The establishment of a public domain energy forecast
model, as called for by the European Parliament in its
Resolution of 14 December 2006 on a European Strategyfor Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy (
1) requires
detailed, up-to-date energy data.
(8) In the coming years, greater attention should be paid to the
security of supply of the most important fuels and more
timely and more accurate data at EU level is needed toanticipate and coordinate EU solutions to possible supplycrises.
(9) The liberalisation of the energy market and its growing
complexity make it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable,
timely energy data in the absence, in particular, of a legalbasis concerning the provision of such data.
(10) In order for the energy statistics system to assist political
decision-making by the European Union and its Member
States and promote public debate which includes citizens, itmust afford guarantees of comparability, transparency,flexibility and ability to evolve. Thus, in the near future,
statistics on nuclear energy should be incorporated and
relevant data concerning renewable energy should bedeveloped more. Similarly, with regard to energy efficiency,the availability of detailed statistics on habitat and transportwould be extremely useful.
(11) The production of Community statistics is governed by the
rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of
17 February 1997 on Community Statistics (2).
(12) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely establishing a
common framework for the production, transmission,
evaluation and dissemination of comparable energystatistics in the Community cannot be sufficiently achievedby the Member States and can therefore be better achievedat Community level, the Community may adopt measures,
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in
Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle ofproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulationdoes not go beyond what is necessary to achieve thatobjective.
(13) In the production and dissemination of Community
statistics under this Regulation, the national andCommunity statistical authorities should take account of
the principles set out in the European Statistics Code ofPractice, which was adopted on 24 February 2005 by theStatistical Programme Committee, established by CouncilDecision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (
3) and attached to the
Recommendation of the Commission on the independence,integrity and accountability of the national and Communitystatistical authorities.
(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this
Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council
Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down theprocedures for the exercise of implementing powersconferred on the Commission (
4).
(15) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commis-
sion to modify the list of data sources, the national statistics
and the applicable clarifications or definitions as well as thetransmission arrangements and to establish and modify theannual nuclear statistics, once incorporated, to modify therenewable energy statistics, once incorporated, and toestablish and modify the final energy consumption
statistics. Since those measures are of general scope and
are designed to amend non-essential elements of thisRegulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordancewith the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for inArticle 5(a) of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(16) It is necessary to provide that the Commission may grant
exemptions or derogations to Member States from those
aspects of the energy data collection that would lead to anexcessive burden on respondents. The exemptions orderogations should be granted only upon receipt of aproper justification which indicates the present situationand the excessive burden transparently. The period forwhich they remain in force should be limited to the shortesttime necessary.
(17) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in
accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme
Committee,

ANNEX B
ANNUAL ENERGY STATISTICS
This Annex describes the scope, units, reported period, frequency, deadline and transmission modalities for the annual
collection of energy statistics.
Annex A applies for explanations of terms for which a specific explanation is not supplied in this Annex.
1. SOLID FOSSIL FUELS AND MANUFACTURED GASES
1.1. Applicable energy products
Unless otherwise specified this data collection applies to all of the following energy products:
Energy product Definition
1. Anthracite High rank coal used for industrial and residential applications. It has generally less
than 10 % volatile matter and a high carbon content (about 90 % fixed carbon). Its
gross calorific value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but
moist basis.
2. Coking coal Bituminous coal with a quality that allows the production of a coke suitable to
support a blast furnace charge. Its gross calorific value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg
(5 700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but moist basis.
3. Other bituminous
coal
(steam coal)Coal used for steam raising purposes and includes all bituminous coal that is neither
included under coking coal nor anthracite. It is characterised by higher volatile
matter than anthracite (more than 10 %) and lower carbon content (less than 90 %
fixed carbon). Its gross calorific value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on
an ash-free but moist basis. If bituminous coal is used in coke ovens it should be
reported as coking coal.
4. Sub-bituminous
CoalRefers to non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value between 17 435 kJ/kg
(4 165 kcal/kg) and 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) containing more than 31 %
volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis.
5. Lignite/brown coal Non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value less than 17 435 kJ/kg (4 165
kcal/kg) and greater than 31 % volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis.
Oil shale and tar sands produced and combusted directly should be reported in this
category. Oil shale and tar sands used as inputs for other transformation processes
should also be reported in this category.
This includes the portion of the oil shale or tar sands consumed in the
transformation process. Shale oil and other products derived from liquefaction
should be reported on the Annual Oil Questionnaire.
6. Peat A combustible soft, porous or compressed, sedimentary deposit of plant origin with
high water content (up to 90 % in the raw state), easily cut, of light to dark brown
colour. Peat used for non-energy purposes is not included.
This definition is without prejudice to the definition of renewable energy sources in
Directive 2001/77/EC and to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories.
7. Patent fuel A composition fuel manufactured from hard coal fines with the addition of a binding
agent. The amount of patent fuel produced may, therefore, be slightly higher than the
actual amount of coal consumed in the transformation process.
8. Coke oven coke The solid product obtained from carbonisation of coal, principally coking coal, at
high temperature, it is low in moisture and volatile matter. Coke oven coke is used
mainly in the iron and steel industry acting as energy source and chemical agent.
Coke breeze and foundry coke are included in this category.
Semi-coke (a solid product obtained from carbonisation of coal at low temperature)
should be included in this category. Semi-coke is used as a domestic fuel or by the
transformation plant itself. This heading also includes coke, coke breeze and semi-
coke made from lignite/brown coal.
9. Gas coke By-product of hard coal used for production of town gas in gasworks. Gas coke is
used for heating purposes.L 304/12 EN Official Journal of the European Union 14.11.2008
====================
Energy product Definition
10. Coal tar A result of the destructive distillation of bituminous coal. Coal tar is the liquid by-
product of the distillation of coal to make coke in the coke oven process or it is
produced from brown coal (low-temperature tar). Coal tar can be further distilled
into different organic products (e.g. benzene, toluene, naphthalene), which normally
would be reported as a feedstock to the petrochemical industry.
11. BKB
(brown coal bri-
quettes)BKB is a composition fuel manufactured from lignite/brown coal, produced by
briquetting under high pressure without the addition of a binding agent. These
figures include peat briquettes, dried lignite fines and dust.
12. Gasworks gas Covers all types of gases produced in public utility or private plants, whose main
purpose is manufacture, transport and distribution of gas. It includes gas produced
by carbonisation (including gas produced by coke ovens and transferred to gasworks
gas), by total gasification with or without enrichment with oil products (LPG,
residual fuel oil, etc.), and by reforming and simple mixing of gases and/or air,
reported under the rows ‘from other sources’. Under the transformation sector
identify amounts of gasworks gas transferred to blended natural gas which will bedistributed and consumed through the natural gas grid.
The production of other coal gases (i.e. coke oven gas, blast furnace gas and oxygen
steel furnace gas) should be reported in the columns concerning such gases, and not
as production of gasworks gas. The coal gases transferred to gasworks plants should
then be reported (in their own column) in the transformation sector in the gasworks
plants row. The total amount of gasworks gas resulting from transfers of other coal
gases should appear in the production line for gasworks gas.
13. Coke oven gas Obtained as a by-product of the manufacture of coke oven coke for the production
of iron and steel.
14. Blast furnace gas Produced during the combustion of coke in blast furnaces in the iron and steel
industry. It is recovered and used as a fuel partly within the plant and partly in othersteel industry processes or in power stations equipped to burn it. The quantity of fuel
should be reported on a gross calorific value basis.
15. Oxygen steel furnace
gasBy-product of the production of steel in an oxygen furnace, recovered on leaving the
furnace. The gas is also known as converter gas, LD gas or BOS gas.
16. Hard coal The term ‘hard coal’ refers to coal of gross calorific value greater than 23 865 kJ/kg
(5 700 kcal/kg) on an ashfree but moist basis and with a mean random reflectance of
vitrinite of at least 0,6. Hard coal comprises all energy products from 1 to 3 together
(anthracite, coking coal and other bituminous coal).

4.1. Applicable energy products
Unless otherwise specified this data collection applies to all of the following energy products:
Energy product Definition
1. Crude oil Crude oil is a mineral oil of natural origin comprising a mixture of hydrocarbons and
associated impurities, such as sulphur. It exists in the liquid phase under normalsurface temperature and pressure and its physical characteristics (density, viscosity,
etc.) are highly variable. This category includes field or lease condensate recovered
from associated and non-associated gas where it is commingled with the commercial
crude oil stream.
2. NGL NGL are liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons recovered from natural gas in separation
facilities or gas processing plants. Natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane
(normal and iso-), (iso) pentane and pentanes plus (sometimes referred to as natural
gasoline or plant condensate).
3. Refinery feedstocks A refinery feedstock is a processed oil destined for further processing (e.g. straight
run fuel oil or vacuum gas oil) excluding blending. With further processing, it will be
transformed into one or more components and/or finished products. This definition
also covers returns from the petrochemical industry to the refining industry (e.g.
pyrolysis gasoline, C4 fractions, gasoil and fuel oil fractions).
4. Additives/oxygen-
atesAdditives are non-hydrocarbon compounds added to or blended with a product to
modify fuel properties (octane, cetane, cold properties, etc.):

tertiary butyl ether), ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether), TAME (tertiary amyl
methyl ether)),
— esters (e.g. rapeseed or dimethylester, etc.),
— chemical compounds (such as TML, TEL and detergents).
Note: quantities of additives/oxygenates (alcohols, ethers, esters and other chemical
compounds) reported in this category should relate to the quantities destined for
blending with fuels or for fuel use.
4.1. Of which: biofuels Biogasoline and bio-diesels. The definitions of Chapter 5, Renewable energy and
