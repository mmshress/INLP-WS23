The Green Papers of the Commission of 22 June 2005 on Energy Efficiency and of 8 March 2006 on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy discuss EU energy policies for which the availability of EU energy statistics are required, including for the purpose of establishing a European Energy Market Observatory.
==========38==========
Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which was adopted on 24 February 2005 by the Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (3) and attached to the Recommendation of the Commission on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities.
==========39==========
(7)
==========40==========
The establishment of a public domain energy forecast model, as called for by the European Parliament in its Resolution of 14 December 2006 on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy (1) requires detailed, up-to-date energy data.
==========41==========
(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures implementing powers the exercise of conferred on the Commission (4).
==========42==========
for

==========44==========
(9)
==========45==========
In the coming years, greater attention should be paid to the security of supply of the most important fuels and more timely and more accurate data at EU level is needed to anticipate and coordinate EU solutions to possible supply crises.
==========46==========
The liberalisation of the energy market and its growing complexity make it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable, timely energy data in the absence, in particular, of a legal basis concerning the provision of such data.
==========47==========
(15)
==========48==========
In particular, power should be conferred on the Commis- sion to modify the list of data sources, the national statistics and the applicable clarifications or definitions as well as the transmission arrangements and to establish and modify the annual nuclear statistics, once incorporated, to modify the renewable energy statistics, once incorporated, and to establish and modify the energy consumption statistics. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non- essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5(a) of Decision 1999/468/EC.

==========51==========
In order for the energy statistics system to assist political decision-making by the European Union and its Member States and promote public debate which includes citizens, it must afford guarantees of comparability, transparency, flexibility and ability to evolve. Thus, in the near future, statistics on nuclear energy should be incorporated and relevant data concerning renewable energy should be developed more. Similarly, with regard to energy efficiency, the availability of detailed statistics on habitat and transport would be extremely useful.
==========52==========
(16)
==========53==========
It is necessary to provide that the Commission may grant exemptions or derogations to Member States from those aspects of the energy data collection that would lead to an excessive burden on respondents. The exemptions or derogations should be granted only upon receipt of a proper justification which indicates the present situation and the excessive burden transparently. The period for which they remain in force should be limited to the shortest time necessary.

Definition
==========347==========
1.
==========348==========
Anthracite
==========349==========
High rank coal used for industrial and residential applications. It has generally less than 10 % volatile matter and a high carbon content (about 90 % fixed carbon). Its gross calorific value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but moist basis.
==========350==========
2.
==========351==========
Coking coal
==========352==========

==========353==========
3.
==========354==========
Other bituminous coal (steam coal)
==========355==========
Coal used for steam raising purposes and includes all bituminous coal that is neither included under coking coal nor anthracite. It is characterised by higher volatile matter than anthracite (more than 10 %) and lower carbon content (less than 90 % fixed carbon). Its gross calorific value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but moist basis. If bituminous coal is used in coke ovens it should be reported as coking coal.
==========356==========
4.
==========357==========
Sub-bituminous Coal
==========358==========
Refers to non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value between 17 435 kJ/kg (4 165 kcal/kg) and 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) containing more than 31 % volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis.
==========359==========
5.
==========360==========
Lignite/brown coal
==========361==========
Non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value less than 17 435 kJ/kg (4 165 kcal/kg) and greater than 31 % volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis. Oil shale and tar sands produced and combusted directly should be reported in this category. Oil shale and tar sands used as inputs for other transformation processes should also be reported in this category. This includes the portion of tar sands consumed in the the oil shale or transformation process. Shale oil and other products derived from liquefaction should be reported on the Annual Oil Questionnaire.
==========362==========
6.
==========363==========
Peat
==========364==========
A combustible soft, porous or compressed, sedimentary deposit of plant origin with high water content (up to 90 % in the raw state), easily cut, of light to dark brown colour. Peat used for non-energy purposes is not included. This definition is without prejudice to the definition of renewable energy sources in Directive 2001/77/EC and to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
==========365==========
7.
==========366==========
Patent fuel
==========367==========
A composition fuel manufactured from hard coal fines with the addition of a binding agent. The amount of patent fuel produced may, therefore, be slightly higher than the actual amount of coal consumed in the transformation process.
==========368==========
8.
==========369==========
Coke oven coke
==========370==========
The solid product obtained from carbonisation of coal, principally coking coal, at high temperature, it is low in moisture and volatile matter. Coke oven coke is used mainly in the iron and steel industry acting as energy source and chemical agent. Coke breeze and foundry coke are included in this category. Semi-coke (a solid product obtained from carbonisation of coal at low temperature) should be included in this category. Semi-coke is used as a domestic fuel or by the transformation plant itself. This heading also includes coke, coke breeze and semi- coke made from lignite/brown coal.
==========371==========
9.
==========372==========
Gas coke
==========373==========

Definition
==========382==========
10. Coal tar
==========383==========
A result of the destructive distillation of bituminous coal. Coal tar is the liquid by- product of the distillation of coal to make coke in the coke oven process or it is produced from brown coal (low-temperature tar). Coal tar can be further distilled into different organic products (e.g. benzene, toluene, naphthalene), which normally would be reported as a feedstock to the petrochemical industry.
==========384==========
11. BKB
==========385==========
(brown coal bri- quettes)
==========386==========
BKB is a composition fuel manufactured from lignite/brown coal, produced by briquetting under high pressure without the addition of a binding agent. These figures include peat briquettes, dried lignite fines and dust.
==========387==========
12. Gasworks gas
==========388==========
Covers all types of gases produced in public utility or private plants, whose main purpose is manufacture, transport and distribution of gas. It includes gas produced by carbonisation (including gas produced by coke ovens and transferred to gasworks gas), by total gasification with or without enrichment with oil products (LPG, residual fuel oil, etc.), and by reforming and simple mixing of gases and/or air, reported under the rows ‘from other sources’. Under the transformation sector identify amounts of gasworks gas transferred to blended natural gas which will be distributed and consumed through the natural gas grid. The production of other coal gases (i.e. coke oven gas, blast furnace gas and oxygen steel furnace gas) should be reported in the columns concerning such gases, and not as production of gasworks gas. The coal gases transferred to gasworks plants should then be reported (in their own column) in the transformation sector in the gasworks plants row. The total amount of gasworks gas resulting from transfers of other coal gases should appear in the production line for gasworks gas.
==========389==========
13. Coke oven gas
==========390==========
Obtained as a by-product of the manufacture of coke oven coke for the production of iron and steel.
==========391==========
14. Blast furnace gas
==========392==========
Produced during the combustion of coke in blast furnaces in the iron and steel industry. It is recovered and used as a fuel partly within the plant and partly in other steel industry processes or in power stations equipped to burn it. The quantity of fuel should be reported on a gross calorific value basis.
==========393==========
15. Oxygen steel furnace gas
==========394==========
By-product of the production of steel in an oxygen furnace, recovered on leaving the furnace. The gas is also known as converter gas, LD gas or BOS gas.
==========395==========
16. Hard coal
==========396==========
The term ‘hard coal’ refers to coal of gross calorific value greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on an ashfree but moist basis and with a mean random reflectance of vitrinite of at least 0,6. Hard coal comprises all energy products from 1 to 3 together (anthracite, coking coal and other bituminous coal).

==========940==========
(including pumped storage) measured at the output terminals of the main generators.
==========941==========
— Gross heat production: the total heat produced by the installation and includes the heat used by the installation's auxiliaries which use a hot fluid (space heating, liquid fuel heating etc.) and losses in the installation/network heat exchanges, as well as heat from chemical processes used as a primary energy form.
==========942==========
— Net electricity production: the gross electricity production less the electrical energy absorbed by the
==========943==========
generating auxiliaries and the losses in the main generator transformers.
==========944==========
— Net heat production: the heat supplied to the distribution system as determined from measurements of the
==========945==========
outgoing and return flows.
==========946==========
The aggregates mentioned in the next table must be declared separately for main activity producer plants and for autoproducer plants.

Definition
==========1556==========
1.
==========1557==========
Crude oil
==========1558==========
Crude oil is a mineral oil of natural origin comprising a mixture of hydrocarbons and associated impurities, such as sulphur. It exists in the liquid phase under normal surface temperature and pressure and its physical characteristics (density, viscosity, etc.) are highly variable. This category includes field or lease condensate recovered from associated and non-associated gas where it is commingled with the commercial crude oil stream.
==========1559==========
2.
==========1560==========
NGL
==========1561==========
NGL are liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons recovered from natural gas in separation facilities or gas processing plants. Natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane (normal and iso-), (iso) pentane and pentanes plus (sometimes referred to as natural gasoline or plant condensate).
==========1562==========
3.
==========1563==========
Refinery feedstocks
==========1564==========
A refinery feedstock is a processed oil destined for further processing (e.g. straight run fuel oil or vacuum gas oil) excluding blending. With further processing, it will be transformed into one or more components and/or finished products. This definition also covers returns from the petrochemical industry to the refining industry (e.g. pyrolysis gasoline, C4 fractions, gasoil and fuel oil fractions).
==========1565==========
4.
==========1566==========
Additives/oxygen- ates
==========1567==========
