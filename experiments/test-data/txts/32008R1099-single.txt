REGULATION (EC) No 1099/2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 22 October 2008

on energy statistics

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

required by Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European the Council of 11 February 2004 Parliament and of concerning a mechanism for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions and for implementing the Kyoto Protocol (2).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu- nity, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),

Whereas:

(4) Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (3) and Directive 2004/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market (4) require Member States to report quantitative energy data. In order to monitor progress towards the achievement of the objectives set in those Directives, detailed, up-to-date energy data are required.

(1)

(2)

The Community needs to have precise and timely data on energy quantities, their forms, sources, generation, supply, the purpose of transformation and consumption, its policy monitoring the impact and consequences of work on energy.

for

Energy statistics have traditionally been focused on energy supply and on fossil energies. In the coming years, greater focus is needed on increased knowledge and monitoring of final energy consumption, renewable energy and nuclear energy.

(5) Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings (5), Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (6) and Directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2005 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using prod- ucts (7) require Member States to report quantitative energy consumption data. To monitor progress the achievement of in those Directives, detailed, up-to-date energy data, as well as a better interface between these energy data and related statistical surveys such as and transportation data, are required.

The Green Papers of the Commission of 22 June 2005 on Energy Efficiency and of 8 March 2006 on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy discuss EU energy policies for which the availability of EU energy statistics are required, including for the purpose of establishing a European Energy Market Observatory.

Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which was adopted on 24 February 2005 by the Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (3) and attached to the Recommendation of the Commission on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities.

(7)

The establishment of a public domain energy forecast model, as called for by the European Parliament in its Resolution of 14 December 2006 on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy (1) requires detailed, up-to-date energy data.

(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures implementing powers the exercise of conferred on the Commission (4).

for

(8)

(9)

In the coming years, greater attention should be paid to the security of supply of the most important fuels and more timely and more accurate data at EU level is needed to anticipate and coordinate EU solutions to possible supply crises.

The liberalisation of the energy market and its growing complexity make it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable, timely energy data in the absence, in particular, of a legal basis concerning the provision of such data.

(15)

In particular, power should be conferred on the Commis- sion to modify the list of data sources, the national statistics and the applicable clarifications or definitions as well as the transmission arrangements and to establish and modify the annual nuclear statistics, once incorporated, to modify the renewable energy statistics, once incorporated, and to establish and modify the energy consumption statistics. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non- essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5(a) of Decision 1999/468/EC.

final

(10)

In order for the energy statistics system to assist political decision-making by the European Union and its Member States and promote public debate which includes citizens, it must afford guarantees of comparability, transparency, flexibility and ability to evolve. Thus, in the near future, statistics on nuclear energy should be incorporated and relevant data concerning renewable energy should be developed more. Similarly, with regard to energy efficiency, the availability of detailed statistics on habitat and transport would be extremely useful.

(16)

It is necessary to provide that the Commission may grant exemptions or derogations to Member States from those aspects of the energy data collection that would lead to an excessive burden on respondents. The exemptions or derogations should be granted only upon receipt of a proper justification which indicates the present situation and the excessive burden transparently. The period for which they remain in force should be limited to the shortest time necessary.

(11) The production of Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics (2).

(17) The measures provided for

in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee,

(12) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely establishing a transmission, common framework for evaluation and dissemination of energy statistics in the Community cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.

Non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value less than 17 435 kJ/kg (4 165 kcal/kg) and greater than 31 % volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis. Oil shale and tar sands produced and combusted directly should be reported in this category. Oil shale and tar sands used as inputs for other transformation processes should also be reported in this category. This includes the portion of tar sands consumed in the the oil shale or transformation process. Shale oil and other products derived from liquefaction should be reported on the Annual Oil Questionnaire.

6.

Peat

A combustible soft, porous or compressed, sedimentary deposit of plant origin with high water content (up to 90 % in the raw state), easily cut, of light to dark brown colour. Peat used for non-energy purposes is not included. This definition is without prejudice to the definition of renewable energy sources in Directive 2001/77/EC and to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

7.

Patent fuel

A composition fuel manufactured from hard coal fines with the addition of a binding agent. The amount of patent fuel produced may, therefore, be slightly higher than the actual amount of coal consumed in the transformation process.

8.

Coke oven coke

The solid product obtained from carbonisation of coal, principally coking coal, at high temperature, it is low in moisture and volatile matter. Coke oven coke is used mainly in the iron and steel industry acting as energy source and chemical agent. Coke breeze and foundry coke are included in this category. Semi-coke (a solid product obtained from carbonisation of coal at low temperature) should be included in this category. Semi-coke is used as a domestic fuel or by the transformation plant itself. This heading also includes coke, coke breeze and semi- coke made from lignite/brown coal.

9.

Gas coke

By-product of hard coal used for production of town gas in gasworks. Gas coke is used for heating purposes.

Definition

10. Coal tar

A result of the destructive distillation of bituminous coal. Coal tar is the liquid by- product of the distillation of coal to make coke in the coke oven process or it is produced from brown coal (low-temperature tar). Coal tar can be further distilled into different organic products (e.g. benzene, toluene, naphthalene), which normally would be reported as a feedstock to the petrochemical industry.

11. BKB

(brown coal bri- quettes)

BKB is a composition fuel manufactured from lignite/brown coal, produced by briquetting under high pressure without the addition of a binding agent. These figures include peat briquettes, dried lignite fines and dust.

12. Gasworks gas

Covers all types of gases produced in public utility or private plants, whose main purpose is manufacture, transport and distribution of gas. It includes gas produced by carbonisation (including gas produced by coke ovens and transferred to gasworks gas), by total gasification with or without enrichment with oil products (LPG, residual fuel oil, etc.), and by reforming and simple mixing of gases and/or air, reported under the rows ‘from other sources’. Under the transformation sector identify amounts of gasworks gas transferred to blended natural gas which will be distributed and consumed through the natural gas grid. The production of other coal gases (i.e. coke oven gas, blast furnace gas and oxygen steel furnace gas) should be reported in the columns concerning such gases, and not as production of gasworks gas. The coal gases transferred to gasworks plants should then be reported (in their own column) in the transformation sector in the gasworks plants row. The total amount of gasworks gas resulting from transfers of other coal gases should appear in the production line for gasworks gas.

13. Coke oven gas

Obtained as a by-product of the manufacture of coke oven coke for the production of iron and steel.

14. Blast furnace gas

Produced during the combustion of coke in blast furnaces in the iron and steel industry. It is recovered and used as a fuel partly within the plant and partly in other steel industry processes or in power stations equipped to burn it. The quantity of fuel should be reported on a gross calorific value basis.

15. Oxygen steel furnace gas

By-product of the production of steel in an oxygen furnace, recovered on leaving the furnace. The gas is also known as converter gas, LD gas or BOS gas.

16. Hard coal

The term ‘hard coal’ refers to coal of gross calorific value greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on an ashfree but moist basis and with a mean random reflectance of vitrinite of at least 0,6. Hard coal comprises all energy products from 1 to 3 together (anthracite, coking coal and other bituminous coal).

OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

Applicable energy products

Unless otherwise specified this data collection applies to all of the following energy products:

Energy product

Definition

1.

Crude oil

Crude oil is a mineral oil of natural origin comprising a mixture of hydrocarbons and associated impurities, such as sulphur. It exists in the liquid phase under normal surface temperature and pressure and its physical characteristics (density, viscosity, etc.) are highly variable. This category includes field or lease condensate recovered from associated and non-associated gas where it is commingled with the commercial crude oil stream.

2.

NGL

NGL are liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons recovered from natural gas in separation facilities or gas processing plants. Natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane (normal and iso-), (iso) pentane and pentanes plus (sometimes referred to as natural gasoline or plant condensate).

3.

Refinery feedstocks

A refinery feedstock is a processed oil destined for further processing (e.g. straight run fuel oil or vacuum gas oil) excluding blending. With further processing, it will be transformed into one or more components and/or finished products. This definition also covers returns from the petrochemical industry to the refining industry (e.g. pyrolysis gasoline, C4 fractions, gasoil and fuel oil fractions).

4.

Additives/oxygen- ates

Additives are non-hydrocarbon compounds added to or blended with a product to modify fuel properties (octane, cetane, cold properties, etc.): — oxygenates, such as alcohols (methanol, ethanol), ethers (such as MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether), ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether), TAME (tertiary amyl methyl ether)),

— esters (e.g. rapeseed or dimethylester, etc.), — chemical compounds (such as TML, TEL and detergents). Note: quantities of additives/oxygenates (alcohols, ethers, esters and other chemical compounds) reported in this category should relate to the quantities destined for blending with fuels or for fuel use.

4.1. Of which: biofuels

Biogasoline and bio-diesels. The definitions of Chapter 5, Renewable energy and energy from waste, apply. Quantities of liquid biofuels reported in this category relate to the biofuel and not to the total volume of liquids into which the biofuels are blended. Excludes all trade of biofuels which have not been blended with transport fuels (i.e. in their pure form); these should be reported as per Chapter 5. The biofuels traded as part of transport fuels should be reported in the appropriate product indicating the biofuel portion.

5.

Other hydrocarbons

Synthetic crude oil from tar sands, shale oil, etc., liquids from coal liquefaction (see Chapter 1), output of liquids from natural gas conversion into gasoline (see Chapter 2), hydrogen and emulsified oils (e.g. orimulsion). Excludes oil shale production, for which Chapter 1 applies. The production of shale oil (secondary product) is to be reported as ‘from other sources’ in the ‘other hydrocarbons category’.

6.

Refinery gas (not liquefied)

Refinery gas includes a mixture of non-condensible gases mainly consisting of hydrogen, methane, ethane and olefins obtained during distillation of crude oil or treatment of oil products (e.g. cracking) in refineries. This also includes gases which are returned from the petrochemical industry.

7.

Ethane

A naturally gaseous straight-chain hydrocarbon (C2H6) extracted from natural gas and refinery gas streams.

8.

LPG

LPG are light paraffinic hydrocarbons derived from the refinery processes, crude oil stabilisation and natural gas processing plants. They consist mainly of propane (C3H8) and butane (C4Hl0) or a combination of the two. They could also include propylene, butylene, isopropylene and isobutylene. LPG are normally liquefied under pressure for transportation and storage.

Definition

Naphtha is a feedstock destined for either the petrochemical industry (e.g. ethylene manufacture or aromatics production) or for gasoline production by reforming or isomerisation within the refinery. Naphtha comprises material in the 30 oC and 210 oC distillation range or part of this range.

Motor gasoline consists of a mixture of light hydrocarbons distilling between 35 oC and 215 oC. It is used as a fuel for land based spark ignition engines. Motor gasoline may include additives, oxygenates and octane enhancers, including lead compounds such as TEL and TML. Includes motor gasoline blending components (excluding additives/oxygenates), e.g. alkylates, isomerate, reformate, cracked gasoline destined for use as finished motor gasoline.

The definitions of Chapter 5, Renewable energy and energy from waste, apply.

Motor spirit prepared especially for aviation piston engines, with an octane number suited to the engine, a freezing point of - 60 oC and a distillation range usually within the limits of 30 oC and 180 oC.

This includes all light hydrocarbon oils for use in aviation turbine power units, distilling between 100 oC and 250 oC. They are obtained by blending kerosenes and gasoline or naphthas in such a way that the aromatic content does not exceed 25 % in volume, and the vapour pressure is between 13,7 kPa and 20,6 kPa.

Distillate used for aviation turbine power units. It has the same distillation characteristics between 150 oC and 300 oC (generally not above 250 oC) and flash point as kerosene. In addition, it has particular specifications (such as freezing point) which are established by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Includes kerosene blending components.

Refined petroleum distillate used in sectors other than aircraft transport. It distils between 150 oC and 300 oC.

Gas/diesel oil is primarily a medium distillate distilling between 180 oC and 380 oC. Includes blending components. Several grades are available depending on uses.

On-road diesel oil for diesel compression ignition (cars, trucks, etc.), usually of low sulphur content.

The definitions of Chapter 5, Renewable energy and energy from waste, apply.

Light heating oil for industrial and commercial uses, marine diesel and diesel used in rail traffic, other gas oil, including heavy gas oils which distil between 380 oC and 540 oC and which are used as petrochemical feedstocks.

All residual (heavy) fuel oils (including those obtained by blending). Kinematic viscosity is above 10 cSt at 80 oC. The flash point is always above 50 oC and density is always more than 0,90 kg/l.

Energy product

Definition

17. White spirit and SBP

Refined distillate intermediates with a distillation in the naphtha/kerosene range. They are subdivided as: — Industrial spirit (SBP): light oils distilling between 30 oC and 200 oC. There are 7 or 8 grades of industrial spirit, depending on the position of the cut in the distillation range. The grades are defined according to the temperature difference between the 5 % volume and 90 % volume distillation points (which is not more than 60 oC).

— White spirit: industrial spirit with a flash point above 30 oC. The distillation

range of white spirit is 135 oC to 200 oC.

18.

Lubricants

Hydrocarbons produced from distillate by-product; they are mainly used to reduce friction between bearing surfaces. Includes all finished grades of lubricating oil, from spindle oil to cylinder oil, and those used in greases, motor oils and all grades of lubricating oil base stocks.

19. Bitumen

Solid, semi-solid or viscous hydrocarbon with a colloidal structure, being brown to black in colour, obtained as a residue in the distillation of crude oil, by vacuum distillation of oil residues from atmospheric distillation. Bitumen is often referred to as asphalt and is primarily used for construction of roads and for roofing material. Includes fluidised and cut back bitumen.

20.

Paraffin waxes

These are saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. These waxes are residues extracted when dewaxing lubricant oils. They have a crystalline structure which is more-or-less fine according to the grade. Their main characteristics are as follows: they are colourless, odourless and translucent, with a melting point above 45 oC.

21.

Petroleum coke

Black solid by-product, obtained mainly by cracking and carbonising petroleum derived feedstock, vacuum bottoms, tar and pitches in processes such as delayed coking or fluid coking. It consists mainly of carbon (90 to 95 %) and has a low ash content. It is used as a feedstock in coke ovens for the steel industry, for heating purposes, for electrode manufacture and for production of chemicals. The two most important qualities are ‘green coke’ and ‘calcinated coke’. Includes ‘catalyst coke’ deposited on the catalyst during refining processes; this coke is not recoverable and is usually burned as refinery fuel.

22. Other products

All products not specifically mentioned above, for example: tar and sulphur. Includes aromatics (e.g. BTX or benzene, toluene and xylene) and olefins (e.g. propylene) produced within refineries.
