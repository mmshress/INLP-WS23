## Project Structure Refactoring 

@KushalGaywala @sid-code14 @mmshress
Started refactoring project structure to make it more modular in terms of configurability to test different text splitters, embedding models, chunk sizes and more attributes that can be configured to test these different components.

@mmshress
Started to create the module for indexing the documents and created a structure to use for index (OpenSearch).
