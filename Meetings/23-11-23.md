## Create Datasets

@KushalGaywala
We need to create a crawl bot to fetch the documents from this [link](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/search.html?name=browse-by%3Alegislation-in-force&type=named&displayProfile=allRelAllConsDocProfile&qid=1696858573178&CC_1_CODED=12).
There are 522 total documents distributed across several type of act.

We could decide on one sub-domain for the final project, and select the dataset accordingly.

We can fetch dataset dataset using CELEX NUMBER which can be exported directly from the website mentioned in #1
There's an option to export the meta data directly from the webpage so it doesn't require any effort to fetch the **CELEX NUMBER** which can be used to fetch the **HTML** format of the data.
To fetch we can modify this link and replace the *\<CELEX NUMBER\>* with the actual **CELEX NUMBER**:
```
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:<CELEX NUMBER>
```

Depending on the model(#13) we have to decide the preprocessing pipeline.
1. We have to analyze the type of tokenization used
2. Analyze the type of word embedding used
These analyzes will be helpful to decide on the model(#13)
