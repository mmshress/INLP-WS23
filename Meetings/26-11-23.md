## Elasticsearch Docker Environment

@KushalGaywala and @mmshress
The text data we fetch should be stored in a datastore of some kind, preferably one with good support for NLP applications. An Elasticsearch environment along with a Kibana frontend to navigate the stored data seems like a viable solution to this problem. Docker should make the environment easily reproducible in all collaborators' local environments as well.
